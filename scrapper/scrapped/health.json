The research from the last few years shows that the way we move affect us not only mechanically, as it was previously thought, but also causes biochemical changes in our cells, changing us from inside out. This process of the body adapting to and being shaped by movement is called mechanotransduction.</p><p>We seem to be living in the world that encourages sitting with the tail tucked under.</p><p>The furniture we use sitting all day is optimised for comfort and convenience, but usually not ergonomically adapted for pelvic floor health. Who would even think about that?</p><p>There is a well spread myth in our society that pelvic floor issues are a normal consequence of ageing or child birth. But we would rarely think of looking for a cause a bit deeper, in the way we have been living and moving before that.</p><p>Did you know that the anatomic function of our remnant of a tail is, amongst others, to control opening and closing of the pelvic outlet? If you look at a dog or a another tailed animal you can see that they keep their tail up happily wagging when they are in a good mood. And this is the default. When you see a dog wearing his tail down between his back legs, it\u2019s usually a sign that the dog is on the fight or flight mode and his pelvic floor is tense as a part of his whole body reacting to danger.</p><p>Even though we now have only a tiny part of what was once a real mammalian tail, it behaves the same. Untucking the tailbone opens the pelvic outlet, tucking it closes it \u2014 tightening the pelvic floor. The dog with his tail down between his legs is an equivalent of you sitting on your sacrum, the back supported by a chair or a couch. If you spend multiple hours a day in this position, your pelvic floor doesn\u2019t really have a chance to release and allow the muscle fibres to regain their natural length at resting state. So gradually it shortens.</p><p>In his book Pelvic Power, dance educator Eric Franklin compares natural movement of the pelvic floor to a kite. As you stand up the pelvic floor slightly lifts and narrows, similarly to a kite picking the wind and taking off. Reversely, as you sit down (with untucked tail, using your sit bones) the pelvic floor widens and releases to its full length, like a kite descending down, opening and landing. But what if we never allow it to release?</p><p>Tight muscle does NOT equal a strong muscle.</p><p>Biomechanist Katy Bowman compares an optimally functioning pelvic floor to a trampoline. It supports the weight of all our pelvic organs and allows any extra load to just bounce off its healthy, elastic fibres, tensing and releasing naturally. Keeping the muscles in the shortened position all the time doesn\u2019t let them perform their function optimally. And further on, as our bodies adapt to the way we use them, we gradually end up with shortened muscles.</p><p>This is why pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) can only be a short term fix. Practising contractions of a muscle isolated from the rest of the body and without allowing it to ever fully release you get a muscle that is tight and locked short. A tight muscle does NOT equal a strong muscle. A strong muscle is able to both fully contract and fully release.</p><p>So why am I telling you all this now? Reading Katy Bowman\u2019s last book \u2014 Move Your DNA, I\u2019ve started to incorporate more variety movement into my life other than and independently from exercising. And especially, I\u2019ve started to squat more, when playing with my toddler, picking things off the floor and going to the toilet.</p><p>Learning how to untuck my tail has made me finally realise why I still had to push my baby out and not bear it gently down, letting the gravity do the job, in spite of all the birth preparations and beautiful relaxation techniques I mastered beforehand.</p><p>To \u201cbreathe the baby out\u201d you have to first untuck your tail.</p><p>Anatomically, in order for the baby to come out the pelvic floor has to release, but you can\u2019t possibly release the pelvic floor with the tailbone tucked under. You can only use the strength of your muscles (transverse abdominals and diaphragm as they instruct you to hold your breath and \u201cpuuuuussssh!\u201d) against your pelvic floor. And that\u2019s a sure way to end up with a nice tear and possibly a pelvic floor disfunction. I was lucky that this mad pushing in my case ended without any serious damage. The body just took over at the last moment and jumped on a dining chair in a strange half-squat with untucked pelvis, fully opening the pelvic outlet. The tucked squats and kneeling with rounded back would have probably taken me to an assisted delivery.</p><p>\u201cModern birthing science has placed a large burden on secreted hormones (like relaxin) to prepare the body for needed mobility.\u201d Katy Bowman says. Yes, relaxin is useful in letting the body open up for the birth, but it\u2019s not enough, unless we have strong, yielding muscles that can fully contract, but also fully release.</p><p>And there is one more thing that we might be missing nowadays.</p><p>In order to have bodies able to smoothly perform all their biological functions, we need to build a whole-body endurance.</p><p>A great way to develop endurance as well as a strong pelvic musculature and a responsive pelvic floor is to walk a lot. You can gradually build up the mileage and frequency of walking in the day. Up the hill, down the hill. Not just on flat pavements but on a variety of terrains and ideally in a shoe that allows your feet to experience and respond to them.</p><p>It\u2019s about building up towards more movement, but also more variety of movement. Gradually adding more and more little movements into your life will allow the body to adapt to them, building capacity to make them easy.</p><p>So, the bottom line is: we really need to get off our tails and sit on the sit bones instead and walk more, squat more, move more. It\u2019s all about really using the body. Reintroducing a frequent and varied movement in our day-to-day life we can gradually reclaim the lost ranges of movement and functional strength.</p><p>Reference list:</p><ul><li>Donald E.

Here\u2019s whyalmost nobody else will!</h1><a></a><a>Noel Dickover</a><a>Aug 18, 2015</a><p>By Noel Dickover, August 2015</p><p>In late 2013, I was pushing close to 300 pounds, and was suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea. I had to use a CPAP machine at night to prevent myself from waking up in a panic, gasping for breath. Worse, my feet were going numb due to back problems, muscle issues or blood sugar problems \u2014 the doctors were not able to identify the cause, so they simply prescribed medication to take away my nerve sensation. I began to question whether I would get to see my own children graduate from college, get married and have grandchildren of their own.</p><p>I knew I had to do something, but I felt that yet another diet would lead me right back to where it always did \u2014 failure. Instead, I decided to try a different route \u2014 I began to think about a gradual approach of changing my movement and eating habits toward a more healthier alternatives that I still enjoyed.</p><p>Since my high of 297 pounds in October 2013, I\u2019ve lost over 100 pounds, and my belt size has gone from 48 to 36. I no longer have diabetes, and am proud to be one of less than 2% of those who have been able to quit taking Metformin after starting it. My blood pressure at one point was 139 over 97 \u2014 my last reading was 112 over 74! My sleep apnea is long gone, and I\u2019ve gone from stress eating to using creative movement routines to alleviate stress.</p><p>Throughout this journey, I never counted calories, fat grams, water intake, nor have I regularly stabbed my finger to see my sugar level. The only external measures I use to measure progress are a scale and my belt size. Even more incredible, I\u2019ve accomplished all this while sustaining a broken foot in July 2014 that did not heal well enough to remove my cast until April 2015!</p><p>This is not a story about dieting, and I don\u2019t have a product to sell. I can eat what I want, whenever I want, in whatever quantities I want. I do make lots better decisions than I used to, and my life is no longer defined by uncontrollable food cravings or binges.</p><p>This is a story about how I learned to get healthy gradually, without guilt, and without unrealistic goals that everyone seems to think are necessary to lose weight. Hopefully you will find ways to apply the approach I have taken into your own journey.</p><h1>Diets as Psychic Prisons</h1><a>https://fela2fela.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/psychic-prison.png</a><p>Over the last 30 years, my weight has risen progressively higher, usually spiking after another failed diet. Like almost all morbidly obese folk, I\u2019ve experimented with my fair share of weight loss schemes, from nutty food regimens like Atkins and SouthBeach, to deranged 7 day cleanse diets, to cocktails of chemically-based metabolism boosters and appetite suppressants that caused jitters and bizarre mood swings. Like most dieters, I never had confidence that diets would amount to anything other than short term gains. Through dieting, my weight yo-yo\u2019d more up than down for 20 years. With each attempt I would lose 10 to 20 pounds, only to gain it all back and more \u2014 this cycle was endlessly repeated, only with new and improved gimmicks that I hoped would be the magical ticket I was seeking. After each attempt ended in failure, intense guilt and loathing soon followed. It seemed clear I just didn\u2019t have the willpower that skinny folk have.</p><p>Unfortunately I\u2019m not alone. A recent report on obesity that followed over 150,000 people concluded that if you are overweight, you are likely to remain that way regardless of the actions you take to get healthy. Of the morbidly obese patients in the study, meaning those in excess of 100 pounds or more \u2014 just one of every 1,290 men, and one of every 677 women returned to normal weight. The full range of solutions offered up for weight loss, regardless of the cost, simply do not work.</p><a>http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_07_08/obesity_adult_07_08.pdf</a><p>In 1980, 15% of the population was obese, with 1.3% morbidly obese. By 2008, obesity had grown to more than 34% of the population, with 6% now morbidly obese. Meanwhile, spending on diet products has skyrocketed. In dietary supplements, spending has more than doubled since 2002. Estimates vary \u2014 in 2006, $35 billion was spent on weight loss products, but most estimates now put that figure over $60 billion by 2014! People are spending money in increasing quantities on diets, while we continue to get fatter as a population. By 2010, a full 63% of Americans were overweight.</p><p>While there is a clearly a correlation, I think its possible a causative link exists between dieting and weight gain \u2014 meaning diets cause the average person to gain more weight than they would have otherwise. Diets ask us to adopt a strange set of tools and behaviors that look nothing like what healthy people do. Have you ever seen a skinny person keep a food journal? How many of them are meticulously counting calories, fat and all the rest? When is this magical switch supposed to occur whereby people who follow all of the experts\u2019 advice for weight loss make that transformation toward doing all the things healthy people do as a normal course? The truth is for the vast majority of us, there is no transformation; \u2014 as the study above shows, there is no light at the end of the dieting tunnel! Dieting simply doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>Bottom line, if you\u2019re looking for the best way to become morbidly obese for the rest of your natural born life, go on a diet! Set weight loss goals! Count your calories, fat and sugar, and keep daily records of your food intake. And then, a few months later, after you\u2019ve failed, self loathed and binged a bit, go on another. This time, try kicking it off with a gym membership that you\u2019ve given no thought about how to integrate into your life. You\u2019ll learn all the behaviors necessary for long term, sustained weight gain. You\u2019ll received advanced training on eating binges and intense craving, and will regularly stress over fruitless expenditures and delusional decisions, along with the self loathing that accompanies it.</p><h1>Diets are psychic prisons for your mind!</h1><p>Like real prison, you are forced to go to diet-induced \u201cpsychic prison\u201d because you\u2019re bad! You\u2019ve done something wrong, and now need to atone through misery!</p><a>http://lewisorgtheory.pbworks.com/w/page/16682148/Psychic%20prisons</a><p>When you decide start a diet, you have literally agreed to create your own self-imposed psychic prison for your mind. This causes you to assume contradictory roles of both the inmate and jailor. You are responsible for both policing your activity, but like all who are incarcerated, feel the intense longing for what you cannot have \u2014 intense and constant food cravings are at the core of your existence. This creates perpetual internal conflict which endlessly fuels your weight gain. Implicit is the notion that your behavior and eating habits are the root cause \u2014 that until you make a radical change, you cannot be rehabilitated. Like real prison, diet-induced psychic prisons imbue people with crippling behavior patterns which will lead to cycles of repeated negative outcomes.</p><p>Each diet foists unfamiliar, unpalatable food choices you are forced to eat in some capacity for the rest of your natural born life, assuming you stay with the plan. They require a radical break from your current eating habits, usually through a controlled set of phases or steps that can be outlined and followed in a plan. A magical gimmick often drives the diet \u2014 a radical health insight, pill, or purchased food product that forms the basis of the unique offering. Coupled with this are the resplendent exercise gizmos of all flavors that constantly seek to assure you your sit-ups will be easier, and that your magical workout to Skinnyville won\u2019t last more than 10 minutes a day.</p><p>I\u2019ve done my share of diet psychic prison time, on and off for the last 30 years.I\u2019m not going back. I can eat what I want, when I want, however much I want.</p><p>Phase I \u2014 Solitary Confinement: Diets often commence with a solitary confinement phase of food choices \u2014 choices which we tolerate for a few days, but are forced to endure for weeks if not months. The rationale is that your behavior is so catastrophic, you must detox completely before any progress can be achieved. The stated reward for completing the cataclysmic beginning? You\u2019re offered the equivalent of food furlough which gives you somewhat edible, but certainly not enjoyable, choices for the rest of your life. You like to eat spaghetti or bread? Too bad, never again! Its only broccoli and tofu from now on, but eventually we\u2019ll let you have low sodium soy sauce and skim cheese with your tofu!</p><p>Time for a Psychic Jail Break! At some point, your diet finally becomes unbearable and you snap. You just can\u2019t take it the regimen any more. It might be triggered by a life event, or just daily stress, but inevitably culminates in a psychic jail break.</p><p>And like all good jail breaks, you\u2019ll want to make the most of it! You might start with a chocolate shake and chicken wings at 10:00 pm while watching the game with friends. But fuck-it, you\u2019ve blown it, so you might as well go to IHOP in the morning to devour that huge steak burrito for breakfast you\u2019ve been craving.</p><p>Intense guilt follows shortly afterwards...</p><p>Shortly after the jail break, you might return to diet prison, or you might not. But at some point you will return, and will repeat the cycle endlessly, each time with false hope some new found magic. If you\u2019re like me, years of yo-yo dieting will leave you significantly overweight and in increasingly poor health.</p><p>Make a Permanent Escape! I\u2019ve done my share of diet prison time on and off for the better part of 30 years \u2014 I\u2019m not going back. I can eat what I want, when I want, and however much I want. I just make healthier decisions now. When I don\u2019t, it\u2019s usually on my terms. If a friend unexpectedly drops by at night, I\u2019ll go out and have a good time, even though it results in waking up a few pounds heavier. It will slow my metabolism a little, and perhaps set me back a few days. That\u2019s the impact. There is no failure or guilt here, just life choices.</p><h1>Gradual Change</h1><p>When I began thinking seriously about how to change my life, I didn\u2019t know where to start, but I knew I wasn\u2019t going back to diet prison. I had a bevy of health issues, so it wasn\u2019t hard to find small places to start experimenting. I choose both a movement idea to experiment with. This resulted in attempts to stretch my feet out each evening, and make healthier eating decisions late at night. I was evaluating my food choices, but had no real compass guiding my behavior. Frankly I was still flailing \u2014 some days doing well, and others poorly, with crushing failure each time I faltered.</p><p>My job takes me to some fascinating places \u2014 in the beginning of 2015 I traveled to Yangon, Myanmar. After work wrapped up, I found myself in Shwedagon Pagoda, a stunning 2600 year-old gold structure surrounded by an elaborate set of ornate temples and buildings. I used to meditate regularly up until my early 20s, and was hoping to recapture that thirst in this historic and holy place. I had this notion that meditation could help me gain insight on how to get healthy. While positioning myself in front of a lavishly adorned deity statue with gaudy flashing colored lights, I sat, closed my eyes and meditated for what felt like a half hour.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I was presented with this monk (pictured above), patently waiting for more than 20 minutes for me to open my eyes. He wanted to know my story, and we had the most incredible conversation. He told me he left to become a monk at 3 years old because \u201cfamily life was hard.\u201d I\u2019m assuming hardships involved food or conflict issues, but never asked. He was very animated in talking about Shwedagon Pagoda and spent the bulk of the conversation relaying his journey to town every Saturday to perform a series of chores and activities at the Pagoda. He revealed how his efforts and the perpetual efforts of his fellow monks over more than two thousand years cultivated the life energy and nurtured the harmony of the pagoda. Shwedegon Pagoda had embraced monks just like him for the duration of its existence, and would do so well into the future. In short the change this monk was trying to achieve, involving deeply meaningful tasks, took place in timescales that well exceeded his own lifespan! He wasn\u2019t interested in getting anywhere \u2014 he wasn\u2019t focused on a short term goal \u2014 it was pure journey.</p><h1>Journey toward getting healthy</h1><p>After the monk and I parted ways, I seriously contemplated what it would mean if I looked at my potential recovery as a journey with clear direction, but without a clear end point. It would not be a quick journey. I spent 30 years developing my failing health profile, it made sense to give myself significant time \u2014 many years perhaps \u2014 to get healthy. Nobody is delusional enough to believe they could stay on a diet more than a year \u2014 we try to last just long enough to depart with at least a shred of dignity so we have a story to share about another flawed diet.</p><p>I looked for small changes \u2014 changes that I couldsuccessfully and permanently integrate into my daily routine.</p><p>Thinking about change in multi-year timescales implies a gradual approach. Numerous life events that impact weight gain, a key source of tension for dieters, will regularly and repeatedly occur during this time \u2014 unexpected visits by relatives leading to late night food excursions, holidays, graduations, and all the rest. Gradual change implies living your life in a normal and happy manner. I was not \u201cplanning for maximal weight loss.\u201d Instead, I looked for small changes to make \u2014 changes that I could successfully and permanently integrate into my daily routine.</p><p>Plan for Multiple Years: Changing the time horizon to a multi-year path fundamentally altered my approach to getting healthy. I decided to dedicate 3 years to this path toward gradually becoming healthy. I didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be healthy or even normal weight by then, but thought it was long enough that I wouldn\u2019t stress about meeting short term weight loss targets. No stressing whether I am \u201con course\u201d or behind. A time span 3 years gave enough time to evaluate whether my journey was successful.</p><p>Here\u2019s the first concrete step I took:</p><p>If I make one small change, like going from \u201cinhaling my food,\u201dto thoroughly chewing it, then if I keep that change for the rest of my life,I will have taken a huge step toward getting healthy.</p><p>All my life I\u2019ve inhaled food. Just a few short bites and down it goes. Where\u2019s the harm in that, right? (more on this below). Each of us is uniquely different. We arrived at our current condition through our own exclusive path, so why would our journey to getting healthy all be the same? Your journey towards a long term, sustained healthy lifestyle will not be like mine. You may not inhale food, but you \u201cknow\u201d of behaviors and activities to regularly engage in that lead to poor health. Choose one \u2014 any one \u2014 a behavior, a new form of movement, a change in eating habits.</p><p>Don\u2019t choose right now! Choose when you\u2019re ready. This is not a \u201cyou must get up off your chair right now or else\u201d type gung-ho solicitation. Experiment with it\u2014 find a way to integrate this change into your life. If what you are trying doesn\u2019t work, try something else, until you find a change you can happily lock in.</p><p>Gradual change means finding small, potential changes that you experiment with, and either integrate in your life or discard. This is a deliberate process, one without stress or grades. Look to integrate new changes carefully, with no more than one, perhaps two at a time, if you include both movement and eating options. Each attempt leads either to a new small but permanent change, or more learning on what doesn\u2019t work for you. The path you choose will be uniquely your own, and will be based on your timeline, your life circumstances and your health profile.</p><p>A journey toward gradual health means:</p><ul><li>Clear direction, but no clear, measurable end point: You know the direction you need to take. It involves numerous but gradual small changes in behavior, eating and movement. But you really don\u2019t know the specific course you will take, which impacts how you measure success. I was not going to \u201chave a weight loss goal\u201d as so many experts demand. The only goal that mattered to me was to be healthy, which implies being normal weight. Short term weight loss goals are fool\u2019s gold (but you can gamify your weight loss! \u2014 see below).</li><li>Heal at your body\u2019s pace: Your body should determine the pace of your healing. If you paying attention to it, you\u2019ll become aware of what\u2019s possible. You can push your system a little, but attempting to lose weight faster \u2014 or going for \u201cmaximum weight loss\u201d as its called in Dietland may lead to short term gains, but almost always ends up as long term loses. You are doing the equivalent of stretching a rubber band and expecting it to stay taught after you remove your hands. If you lose weight faster than your body is ready for, it will rebound.</li><li>Experiment before deciding: Integrating a new behavior, lifestyle alteration, new stretch or exercise is a seemingly small change, but is monumental if you make it stick. This is nontrivial and may require multiple attempts before you can do it consistently.</li><li>Changes must be enjoyable: Changes that become permanently integrated into your life will be enjoyable ones. If it\u2019s something you dread, you will eventually stop. This means replacing bad food choices with healthier ones that you enjoy! If you don\u2019t enjoy it, keep looking for other alternatives. Same with exercise \u2014 it must be something you get satisfaction from if you expect to continue it.</li><li>No restrictions, just better decisions: I can eat whatever I want, whenever I want. I\u2019m not in diet prison. If I force food restrictions on myself, I will dream, than fantasize then fixate on accomplishing the health goal to get the restrictions removed. This is diet-speak for, \u201cFuck you, once I accomplish your goal, I\u2019m binging, baby!\u201d Instead of giving up all junk food at once to go \u201ccold turkey,\u201d I gradually and deliberately found ways to improve my eating habits and activity level.</li></ul><h1>Good habits compound</h1><p>When you\u2019re overweight and exhibit negative health habits, they tend to compound. My weight gain led to lower back pain, and crippling ankle and foot problems. My weight gain also led to diabetes, high blood pressure, and sleep apnea. Bad behaviors for health are similar to bad financial behaviors that lead to spiraling debt, but the reverse is also true.</p><p>Here\u2019s the good news \u2014 small, positive behaviors for improving your health compound as well or better than negative behaviors!</p><p>When I started my journey I didn\u2019t even fantasize I would be anywhere near 50 pounds lighter a year later, but in reality I flew by 250 pounds. Here\u2019s the good news \u2014 small, positive behaviors for improving your health compound as well or better than negative behaviors! Stretching regularly will lead to more flexibility, which leads to more movement, and better food choices. Over time, each of these behaviors leads to weight loss at a rate far faster than I could have dreamed!</p><p>You will not be successful if you attempt to change everything at once, nor do you need to. That\u2019s a recipe for failure and guilt. Instead, focus on integrating one new change at a time. Do so slowly and deliberately. You may not be able to give up eating primarily pizza, beer, hamburgers, fries and soda all in one week. Dietary changes should be gradual and deliberate, as should exercise routines, and overall behavior changes.</p><h1>Gamify Your Weight Loss</h1><p>Most professional advice on weight loss will emphasize the critical need to have clear weight loss goals. The Mayo clinic recommends you make goals that are \u201cspecific, measurable, attainable, realistic and trackable\u201d \u2014 realistic in this sense means between 5\u201310% body weight. If you are morbidly obese, why would you only want to lose 5% of your body weight? I\u2018ve lost over 1/3 of my body weight, but I\u2019ve never had a weight loss goal that I inevitably end up fixating over. This is a short term goal, which perpetuates the quick fix mindset towards health. I strongly recommend you throw away your weight loss goals, along with your calorie counters.</p><p>While I argue against clear, measurable, attainable, realistic and trackable weight loss goals, I do agree its necessary to have a clear process for gauging progress, one which focuses energy toward a goal. With the help of a gamification expert, I devised a process of gamifying my weight loss.</p><p>Gamifying your weight loss in 10 pound increments with steady state breaks removes the \u201calways on\u201d stress that diets require</p><p>Lose weight in 10 pound increments but not all the time: Aside for the first 12 pounds or so, I\u2019ve lost my weight in 10 pound increments. I accomplished this by undertaking a series of \u201chealth sprints\u201d followed by steady state \u201cbreaks\u201d. Diets require you to be close to perfect all the time \u2014 we don\u2019t work that way. We are more successful varying our routine. I give myself time to prepare for a health sprint, and then give myself time to go easy in the interim rest periods. In my rest period, or steady state break as I call it, I\u2019m probably not going to \u201cgo hog wild\u201d with hamburger binges at 11:30 at night. But I am more likely to have an occasional healthy hamburger (grass-fed, all natural burger on a good bun, not McDonalds) at 1:00 pm during my steady state, then I am during a health sprint. I will still be exercising and generally eating well according to the small changes I\u2019ve made, but I won\u2019t be optimizing. Here\u2019s how the gamification process works:</p><h1>\u201c2\u201d \u2014 the start of the health sprint</h1><p>Whenever I reach the \u201c2,\u201d in the 10 pound increment, such as when I reached 282, 272, 262, 252, 242, 232, 222, 212, or 202, I \u201clock in\u201d on my eating and movement to perform a \u201chealth sprint.\u201d This means I am generally engaging in movement every day (exercise or stretching), and am trying my best to eat reasonable, healthy foods until my weight gets to the next lower \u201c7\u201d, such as when I went from 282 down to 277. Even if I eat poorly at 277, chances are good I\u2019ll still be below 280, which keeps me in the 10 pound increment. In game terms, once I reach the \u201c7\u201d, I tell myself I have successfully reached the 270s! This is in effect attaining a \u201clevel up\u201d in my personal health game.</p><h1>7 to 2 \u2014 the healthy steady state break</h1><p>Once I get to the \u201c7\u201d, such as 287, 277, or 197 as in my current situation, I slowly ease up and settle into a healthy steady state. This may last weeks, or even longer in the case of lower weight levels like 227, 217, and 207. But eventually, I slowly start drifting down to the \u201c2\u201d again, and get ready for another health sprint. This drifting is most often caused by the newer behavior or activity changes I\u2019ve added, or because I\u2019ve started slowly locking down my habits to get ready for another sprint.</p><p>This approach toward gamifying your weight loss in 10 pound increments removes the \u201calways on\u201d stress that diets require. It also removes a time component \u2014 you don\u2019t really know when you\u2019ll leave the 260s, which is just fine. Your time horizon is such that you plan on getting healthy eventually, over time \u2014 not next week! Gamification also provides a clear signal when you gone off the rails in a significant way. Its never fun going up a level in a game \u2014 the same thing applies here. The days I went back up a weight level \u2014 and I did multiple times \u2014 had me seriously focusing my actions to return.</p><h1>Weight loss levels get harder over time</h1><a>http://www.teq.com/blog/2015/04/gamification-pavlov-classroom-management-part-2-5/#.VdKUFCZViko</a><p>Gamifying your weight loss in 10 pound increments mimics normal game dynamics. Like most games, the levels get harder as you progress in lower weight and improve your skills. It\u2019s relatively easy to drop from 282 to 277, but is significantly harder to go from 222 to 217. The gamification works because you too are improving. The actions you take at 222 to get healthy will be significantly different than what you did at 282.</p><p>In my journey, there were times when my body seemed determined to stay around a particular weight. Looking back, the 270s, 220s and the 200s were especially difficult to overcome. But if you generally stay on your path, eventually you will find yourself ready to do another sprint, and with success, will level up to your new weight class. This provides a sense of joy and accomplishment that helps sustain your journey. Over time, you will be amazed how far you\u2019ve come!</p><h1>Internal Health Measures</h1><p>Deluxe, often expensive Internet of Things (IoT) personal tracking devices like Fitbit or the new Apple watch are the rage right now. Just pay $99.99 and get your calories counted, heart rate monitored, your blood pressure measured, your steps counted, your sleeping patterns graphed, and bloody sugar levels tracked regularly. I really have an aversion to the entire product set, because the focus is wrong. These products get you to think of your body as an mysterious black box that requires external scientific measures to generate reliable data.</p><p>Your body is a living system. It doesn\u2019t operate in \u201cper day\u201d increments.Your body operates in the here and now, whether or not you\u2019re noticing.You can become aware of it\u2026will you?</p><p>Further, these products seem to buy into the delusion that external goals should drive the pace of your recovery, not the actual and current condition of your body. You want to lose 30 pounds in 6 weeks? You can now measure your progress in real time! These products optimize your time, and our bodies just have get with the program! To be clear, I am not opposed to datasets or sensors for data collection\u2014 my day job involves finding aggregating and applying data from harsh environments in really creative ways. I just think the costs for using it personally far outweight the benefits.</p><p>That said, I do have friends who are using IoT products to successfully lose weight. If you\u2019re using Fitbit, cell phone apps, Apple watch or some other hip device and its helping you get healthy, congrats and keep rocking it! If its working over the long term, use it! The section below provides an alternative approach to external measures \u2014 one that is at odds with the current external measures trend. So if you\u2019ve settled into a happy partnership with your Fitbit and are afraid of offending it, feel free to skip down to the \u201cMovement and Eating\u201d section below.</p><h1>The anti-Fitbit approach</h1><p>Experts say you should drink X cups of water per day, Y calories per day, that you should limit your carb and fat intake to Z grams \u2014 you know the routine. With no data other than my own experience in losing over 100 pounds, I\u2019ve decided that\u2019s all bullshit \u2014 the whole approach is flawed. As we see above, this advice is not helping people lose weight. Worse, the reliance on external measures solidifies the view of the human body as a near undecipherable black box \u2014 one that causes us to quickly lose confidence in our own perceptions. And in doing so, we stop paying attention to clear signals and rich feedback our bodies are constantly providing. Not surprisingly, the new innovations in personal tracking devices line up perfectly with new and improved, data-enabled 5 step diet plans, that if you only follow to perfection will allow you to\u2026its all bullshit.</p><p>Your body is an organic, living system. This means it doesn\u2019t operate in \u201cper day\u201d increments. Your body operates in the here and now. Whether not you\u2019re pay attention, your body continually regulates itself in real-time. Diets are designed as if your body was an engineered machine that is missing a gasket or two, but living systems simply don\u2019t function that way \u2014 they aren\u2019t analogous. Engineered machines like precise instructions and reliable measurements, and constant improvement. But your body is constantly adjusting to a whole series of internal and external purturbations \u2014 this implies prescribed totals quickly lose their utility. There is a tenuous connection at best between what the prescribed daily totals for someone like you \u201cshould be\u201d and what your body actually requires at this very moment.</p><p>Your body\u2019s actual functioning in the present and next few hours are critical, but daily totals at the end of the day are near meaningless. I\u2019m suggesting that like most skinny people, it is important for the rest of us to develop a deeper awareness of our body\u2019s functioning \u2014 one that will inform our decisions on food and movement choices far more effectively than any professional health plan.</p><h1>Look inward for your measures</h1><p>To paraphrase Darth Vader,</p><p>\u201cThe power of the Fitbit pales in comparison to power of your own ability to understand what is occurring within you in the ever living present. I find your lack of faith in yourself disturbing.\u201d</p><p>You either \u201cdo\u201d or \u201cdo not\u201d need water right now, but chances are, if you\u2019re exercising regularly and regulating your metabolism you\u2018ll be drinking water heavily. Put simply, guidelines to drink 12 cups of water per bullshit period time in absence of actual movement will not improve your health or disposition.</p><p>As a living system, your body still abides by the laws of nature \u2014 if health goals are disconnected from your actual state of health, they won\u2019t succeed. You might lose that fast 5\u201320 pounds, but we both know you\u2019ll have more weight than you started a few months later. Long term change comes from understanding your body\u2019s current state \u2014 this gives you the knowledge necessary to make the right changes for you, one by one, gradually and permanently over time. Understanding your body\u2019s current state requires learning to pay attention to what is happening inside. This is a very knowable thing \u2014 something a large percentage of skinny people do naturally.</p><p>The Measures that Matter: If I\u2019m not counting calories or fat, or poking myself daily for sugar levels, how can I gauge progress? My approach to getting healthy has as its core developing deep awareness of how my body functions. Like all gradual change, this is a long term effort that yields greater dividends the more skill you attain. Understanding both my internal motor and physical condition has been critical to my journey. For measures directly affecting weight loss and diabetes recovery, I pay attention to three key things:</p><p>\u2014 Energy level \u2014 Metabolism \u2014 Sugar level</p><p>ENERGY LEVEL: Start with your energy level. Everyone can feel if they are energetic or not. I\u2019m asking you to pay regular and explicit attention to your energy level, not unlike your awareness of the room temperature. This takes practice \u2014 for me it took well over a month to really lock this in.</p><p>I would try to ask myself almost hourly, \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, what is my current energy level?</p><p>Once you do, you\u2019ll begin notice a clear relationship between food you eat, both type and quantity and its impact on your energy level. For me, this was the key to changing my eating habits. When I looked at a lunch menu and fixated on something large and heavy, once I knew intimately and repeatedly what happens to my energy the immediate enjoyment factor drops \u2014 I started selecting better choices because of it. Again I stress that this is a not a day revelation \u2014 this takes weeks if not longer.</p><p>Over time, you can use your awareness of energy levels to make small changes in your food and movement choices. Awareness of your current energy level will prompt you to find reasons to get up and move around once an hour, or you might find yourself eating more snacks along with smaller sized meals far more often. This approach is VERY different from keeping track of calories. In essence, you are paying attention to the internal impact of the calories in the here and now. That\u2019s the only time they calories are relevant. The fat either will or will not have been added to your gut by the time you calculate your caloric intake the end of the day.</p><p>Once you are comfortably keeping track of energy levels and regularly notice the impact of your food choices, you are ready to gain better awareness of your body\u2019s motor \u2014 your metabolism.</p><p>METABOLISM: Energy awareness is the gateway to gaining awareness of your metabolism. Your metabolism is the engine that powers the living system that is you. Its processing can be felt, and eventually optimized in the sense that there are natural ways to speed it up. But in the beginning, start paying attention to it in the same way you do your energy level. This will take you a few months of effort, so don\u2019t be discouraged if you aren\u2019t successful after a day or two.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever lost weight, at times you can \u201cfeel\u201d almost a tingly sensation when you perceive you are losing weight \u2014 this is usually accompanied by higher energy levels. Similarly if you pay attention, you can \u201cfeel\u201d when you are gaining weight. This is not magic \u2014 its a knowable thing that lots of skinny people take for granted. If you gain awareness of your body\u2019s engine, you can gain control over your weight loss. If you understand what your metabolism is doing, you have the knowledge necessary to guide your eating and movement choices.</p><p>Get to Know Your Stomach: The key for sustained attention to your metabolism is your stomach. If you\u2019re like I was, you have no idea what\u2019s happening in your stomach. I rarely paid attention to how my eating habits directly led to mood swings or energy spikes. As a consequence, I used to ingest 2\u20133 Pepsid ACs a day \u2014 now I take less than that in a month! If acid reflux is a regular part of your day, chances are good that your stomach seldom processes your food properly, and has long since resorted to just \u201csending it on\u201d to the small intestine where your food sits and is digested slowly and poorly.</p><p>Chew Your Food! If you\u2019re interested in developing a deeper awareness of your stomach, try learning chew your food very thoroughly. I used to decide I was full when my taste buds were satiated. By this point, if the food was tasty, my stomach was usually stuffed to the point of breaking. To stop the cycle, the stomach eventually initiates its \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014stomach acid starts shooting up into my mouth to ruin my taste. Acid reflux is the stomach\u2019s way of getting the mouth to stop overeating. Like all nuclear options, the side effects aren\u2019t good. If you chew your food thoroughly, you are pre-digesting it for the stomach in a way that it can take the next step in the digestion process. Food that\u2019s properly chewed leads to quicker, better faster processing by the stomach, which leads to a faster metabolism rate. More importantly, it allows you to pay attention to your body\u2019s engine.</p><p>I went from chowing down three large meals a day to consuminglots of small meals all day long</p><p>Over time, I began looking for ways to optimize my metabolism. I did this through food choices, supplements and most importantly, my eating frequency. I went from chowing down three large meals a day to consuming somewhere between 10\u201320 small meals all day long. In keeping my metabolism at a high burn rate, I usually try to keep my stomach just above empty. As soon as I feel hunger pangs, I eat a small snack. I have lots of healthy, but mostly delicious things to eat. I now keep snacks everywhere and am constantly eating. As a consequence, my stomach has shrank so much that even if I wanted to binge, I can only eat a small amount before feeling bloated.</p><p>SUGAR LEVEL: After a few months of paying deep attention to my metabolism, I began to regularly sense of my sugar level. At first, it was most easily felt when I had something overly sweet. Most people can feel a sugar rush if they eat large quantities of candy. This is no different, except in the sense I became hyper-aware of it, even when I wasn\u2019t indulging in sweets. As I ate food, I became aware of its near term impact on my sugar level. My goal was to stop the spikes in sugar (which often correspond to spikes in energy levels), and to slowly lower the overall sugar levels over time. As I mentioned earlier, I applied this approach without regularly poking my finger, so I can\u2019t give you any statistics of my rate of decline. I will say that over a period of 6 months, my doctor slowly lowered and then eliminated my drug reminen.</p><p>If you\u2019re diabetic and on Metformin, the challenge in getting off is that Metformin is designed to keep your sugar levels in the normal range (this is a good thing). Once I developed better awareness of my sugar level, I attempted to keep my sugar levels regularly slightly below what I perceived as normal. This led to doctor-approved reductions in Metformin (from 2 pills to one, to a half, and then finally the doctor removed them altogether). If you try this approach and start getting faint spells (this definitely happened to me), it\u2019s probably a sign your sugar level is too low. If so, this is where you want to talk with your doctor about reductions in Metformin intake.</p><p>The measures that matter \u2014 the ones that will help you get healthy \u2014 are internal</p><p>Use of Personal Tracking Devices Sap Confidence in Internal Measures: The Fitbit approach will give you exact measures (we hope), but at the cost of reducing confidence in your ability to understand your internal operations. By relying on external measures, you give more credence to its \u201crightness\u201d and less to internal measures that are inexact and untrackable. But the measures that matter \u2014 the ones that will help you get healthy, are all internal. I\u2019ve only listed those critical to metabolism, but your perception in engaging in movement and exercise is just as critical\u2014 the two are connected.</p><p>Sure, you could poke your finger 20 minutes after eating each meal \u2014 this would work as a method for understanding your spikes. But it\u2019s not necessary- there\u2019s nothing magical about becoming aware of your internal workings. Large numbers of skinny people manage themselves naturally by paying attention to their bodies. This is a learned skill \u2014 one you can develop and improve on over time. If you learn to pay deep awareness to your internal measures, you will find they are transformative in their ability to change your future in ways that external devices simply cannot touch.</p><h1>Movement and Eating</h1><p>Movement and eating healthy are both critical to weight loss. If your diet consists of pizza multiple times a week, sports bars late at night, pop tarts in the morning and 2\u20133 cans of soda a day, you will need to make some changes in your eating habits. Likewise, if you pride yourself on your couch potato ways, you will also need to make some changes in your movement. This is different from saying you will never eat pizza again, and will have to do a full circuit routine every day. Make the changes gradually, in ways you enjoy. Getting healthy is not about pain and force of will. It\u2019s about finding enjoyable but healthier alternatives to eating, and enjoyable ways of movement. In my case, over the course of my journey, I gradually went from being a stress eater to a stress exerciser \u2014 this from someone who never enjoyed exercising before.</p><p>I have a lot lessons to share, and decided to give a sampling below. If these are of interest, let me know in the comments section below, and I will create videos or something to go into more detail.</p><h1>Garbage In, Garbage Stays!</h1><a>http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140828/lifestyle-health-and-wellbeing/article/junk-food-may-kill-your-appetite-balanced-diet</a><p>We all have different eating habits, but it\u2019s clear that processed foods aren\u2019t food. Processed foods are made to look edible, but your body has limited ability to process them. They slow your body\u2019s metabolism and leave long term residues. Processed foods have significant, long term negative impacts on your health.</p><p>If you want to improve your metabolism and develop deep awareness to what is happening inside of you, you\u2019ll need to slowly ween yourself off of processed foods. Processed foods are designed to be addictive, and usually contain a potent cocktail of sweet, salty, and fatty flavors. The combination of the three removes your ability to control your cravings. Lays potato chips really do have truth in advertising \u2014 they are designed to ensure that you \u201cjust can\u2019t eat one!\u201d</p><p>This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never be able to eat all the foods you love. But it does mean you find yourself paying more for better quality alternatives. I\u2019m a chocoholic, and MUST have chocolate every day. Now I go with all natural 65-70% cocoa (80% enters the no taste zone) with delicious additive ingredients like berries, coconut or nuts. I still want hamburgers and fries every so often, but it\u2019s never at McD\u2019s or Wendys. I go to upscale, grass-fed beef places, and often substitute sweet potato fries. You\u2019ll still be eating most of the things you enjoy, but hopefully, you\u2019ll do so in moderation, and not at 10:30 at night!</p><h1>Gradual approach to exercise</h1><p>When I was 270+ pounds (for the majority of the last 15\u201320 years), every so often I would attain the willpower to try exercising as a regular routine. I usually started out well, but soon after I would end up pulling a muscle so severely that I was forced to stop my exercise for a week, which get me off track, often resulting in ceasing my efforts altother. I\u2019ve also tried gym memberships that, after an initial crazy and unsustainable burst, I stopped going but still kept paying; a personal trainer who regularly pushed me to exhaustion, and various other delusional fits and starts. I haven\u2019t tried exercise boot camps, but can already see the futility there \u2014 yet another short term quick fix approach that will ultimately lead you weighing more than you started.</p><p>Start with What You Have: Purchasing a gym membership is not a \u201cfirst step\u201d toward getting healthy. It\u2019s a loss of $50 bucks a month. If you don\u2019t use it, it doesn\u2019t exist. Instead of wasting money on something you may not use, start with what you have. In my case, I had some small free weights, a chair, a sitting bench and a floor in my bedroom. This was more than enough to get started.</p><p>Movement is Fun First, Useful Second: So many sales pitches for exercise products talk about optimizing your time. Basically they say, \u201cYou only have to suffer 20 minutes a day. But its ultra comfortable suffering!\u201d (jail break alert). I optimize enjoyment in my movement routines. I don\u2019t \u201ctry to get through them\u201d as quickly as possible, and I don\u2019t really schedule them. I often integrate movement routines in small bits throughout the day. If I have time for an early morning workout, terrific! I love that, but it doesn\u2019t kill my day from a movement standpoint if I miss it. And at this point in my journey, I NEVER exercise because I have to in order to get healthy. I do my routines because my body now craves it, and really, because they\u2019re really fun! If movement is fun, as opposed to exercise you need to endure, you\u2019re more likely to sustain your efforts for life.</p><p>Injuries Do Not Have to Kill Your Progress: Unfortunately for me, after I was in better shape to exercise, I broke my foot in a freak accident. After a short period of self-pity, I found new methods of movement ones that would allow me to continue improving my movement and health. I gravitated toward exercising wooden swords on my son\u2019s old, sparsely used plastic Tae Kwon Do kicking post. Because my foot was broken, I focused on my core, with various routines using four different sized wooden swords \u2014 I always had one foot always planted. This exercise regimen had the amazing side benefit of bestowing significantly increased flexibility in my back. For me, what could have been a setback to getting healthy became a reason to try something new and different \u2014 to get creative and see what worked for me.</p><p>Stretching Over Exercise: If you\u2019ve been sedentary for an extended duration, you probably aren\u2019t ready for a full exercise regime. In my case, my foot pain restricted my exercise options. Instead, consider a goal of increasing your flexibility through stretching. For my first five months of weight loss I exercised sparsely, but engaged in stretching on a daily basis. Over time, stretching became a meditative release for me, something I looked forward to performing.</p><p>Quality Stretches Last Minutes, not Seconds: The purpose of the stretch is to slowly get the muscles to release their tension \u2014 to become looser. This doesn\u2019t happen quickly. In practice, my stretches can easily last 4 or 5 minutes. For me, it\u2019s a meditative thing. I don\u2019t go for as hard a stretch as possible. Instead I stretch to the point that it\u2019s definitely uncomfortable, and keep it there until I feel the muscle \u201crelease\u201d a little. I normally stretch until the muscle releases, and then keep the stretch until it stabilizes in its new looser position. Over time, I gradually increased my flexibility throughout my body to the point that I looked forward to regular exercise.</p><p>Stop Counting Reps and Listen to your Body! I used to buy into the optimization thing, which includes tracking reps and weight, with the intent of improving it over time. This is pretty much the accepted way most think of exercise. I always tried to beat my previous score well before I was ready. In practice, I focused on reaching \u201cthe number\u201d, such as a set of 10 squats. But by focusing on reaching 10 squats, I wasn\u2019t paying attention to how my body was responding. For me, this is a recipe for disaster. I usually end up pulling something at rep 7, but still power through until 10. If I had stopped a rep or two earlier, it would have been a minor thing, but instead I\u2019d end up with a debilitating tear. In exercising, I now listen to my body first and foremost.</p><p>My approach for the past year has been to perform my current exercise for as long as I can, without keeping track of the number. My focus is on my body so if something feels wrong, I stop immediately and stretch out the area. If not, I go as long as I can before exhaustion or lack of will to continue stops me. Sometimes I like to go all tough guy and push myself, while other times, my body just doesn\u2019t feel like it. Instead of \u201cpushing through\u201d, now I simply do a lesser workout when my body pushes back.</p><p>My routine, if you can call it that, is never regular, but is usually both fun and stress relieving. I\u2019ll hang out on a stationary bike if I want to meditate, but far more often I\u2019ll have lots of different activities to try. This includes 4 sizes of wooden swords that I jazz on, various forms of plank exercises, to recently experimenting with running. Bottom line, I\u2019m don\u2019t optimize my exercise time \u2014 I optimize my enjoyment. Slow improvement works fine for me, especially if its enjoyable enough to do it regularly.</p><h1>Posture: Get rid of the zombie walk</h1><p>Good posture is a critical to living a healthy life. As I started to lose weight I became increasingly interested in examining my posture. For the better part of at least 20 years, I had what I affectionately refer to as the \u201czombie walk.\u201d Because of my immense belly size, I ended up balancing my weight on my frame \u2014on the stress points \u2014 the lower back and ankles in my case, the knees in others. I also developed significant stress on my neck, which was caused by moving my head back in order to counter-balance the weight of my stomach. Walking for me involved \u201cfalling forward\u201d not too unlike a zombie with my legs locked. The zombie walk as the two-fold negative benefit of damaging your stress points, while expending as little energy as possible to move around. Go to any public gathering where people are milling about and you\u2019ll see the zombie walk practiced in abundance!</p><p>I\u2019ve since changed my posture to maintain the majority of weight on my upper legs and core. This took many months of practice to make the shift, and requires lots of strength exercises (squats) to adequately support the weight. The advantage of my new posture is my stress points no longer holds the majority of my weight throughout the day . Moreso, by shifting my weight bearing to my legs and core, I burn up the calories just by walking around!</p><p>Bottom line, if you are significantly overweight your current posture is may be the result of your body attempting to mitigate your weight gain. Your current stance and gait may work for you, but it may also be leading to long term debilitations in your movement and flexibility. If so, experiment with changes to your posture, especially as you lose weight. As your body type changes, so too should your posture.</p><h1>Fascia \u2014 where your tension is stored</h1><a>http://www.peagreenphysio.co.uk/fascinating-fascia/</a><p>This is a new discovery for me, but I\u2019m beginning to understand that our stress and tension can be transferred from the mind to the body. I add this section especially for those suffering chronic foot pain \u2014 up until a few weeks ago, my toes were still regularly going numb, and pain still persisted. Over time, tension and stress, either from physical or mental ailments can end up being transferred and stored in the body\u2019s fascia, a thin tissue that covers all our muscles throughout the body. I developed what I refer to as \u201chuman barnacles,\u201d where masses of tissue have solidified to almost feel like bone. This dynamic exists all around my body from the fascia in my chest releasing tension in my shoulders.</p><p>A few weeks back, I found myself in Neredu Valley, as remote a location as you can find in India, and where many of the pictures you see here originated. There I had a chance encounter with Nath Yogi named Ashwin Mohan, who shared this massage technique with me. I think Ashwin calls it yogamukti therapy, which incorporates really empowering ways of mind-body healing. In a cursory look, in the US, I think the non-spiritual part of what Ashwin talks about is referred to myofacial release.</p><p>Even after losing over 100 pounds, and getting in the best physical shape of my life, I still had numbness in my feet. I have a drawer full of wool socks I wear starting in late fall due to them always feeling cold. But by softly working out the fascia tightly coupled to my shins, for instance, tension is immediately released around my big toe. After like 10 minutes of Ashwin massaging my feet and legs, I had this strange sensation flooding my feet \u2014 something new and wonderful. I asked Ashwin what it was. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s the blood returning to my toes.\u201d The fascia had tightened to the point that it was restricting the muscles and blood flow! Since then, I have spent the better part of the past week slowly working out fascia tension in my legs, which immediately loosens my feet! I showed my chiropractor this technique \u2014 he applied it to my back, which led to significant easing of tension in my legs, feet and neck. I understand its also effective for migrains and headaches.</p><p>Up until last week, I still pictured body image as being that of someone far heavier. Once I\u2019ve started working on alleviating and removing the tension in my fascia, it has changed my body image completely. By getting rid of all my stored tension in my toes and shoulders and back, I now feel like a normal sized person!</p><h1>What\u2019s Next for Me?</h1><p>I\u2019m over 20 months in to my 3 year journey to get healthy. The fact that I\u2019ve lost over 100 pounds does not mean I\u2019ve finished. Currently I\u2019m sitting between 197 and 192 pounds in a steady state. I still intend to lose more, but realistically, my focus has shifted towards other health goals like continuing to heal my lower back, feet and ankles. I\u2019m learning ways to use my body\u2019s energy for self-healing, but that is another post.</p><p>Each personal health journey is unique. I hope you start yours!</p><p>Note on the Inclusion of Nature Photos: A number of the photos you see here are from a very recent trip I made to a healing and meditation center Neredu Valley, India, a very remote part of Andhra Pradesh, India. In addition to serving as a capstone experience to my health journey, I add these photos because the guidance in this story is very eastern in flavor. To me, the photos totally add to the vibe. The leopard track is an external measure of its existance. The woman serving coconut water epitomizes healthy movement and eating, and so on. Apologies if they don\u2019t work for you.</p><p>And regarding that capstone experience in Neredu Valley, in addition to Ashwin, special thanks to Arjun, Deepta, and especially my son, Justin for that magical time in Neredu (and to my wife Nam for all those yummy food experiments). Also thanks to Vuaneeta strives to live her life in Neredu always in the present; but who will never read this as she is disconnected from that \u201cthing.\u201d Also, special thanks to Gigi for the edits!</p><h2>One last thing\u2026</h2><p>If you liked this, click the\ud83d\udc9a below so other people will see it here on Medium.</p>", "tags": ["Weight Loss", "Diet", "Diabetes", "Health", "Exercise"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*Uz1bvUYWbBKNqVhis43kZQ.png"], "url": "https://wilw.medium.com/7-things-i-did-to-reboot-my-life-a4bab2d409e", "dateCreated": "2015-10-24T20:51:49.118Z", "datePublished": "2015-10-24T20:51:49.118Z", "dateModified": "2018-06-14T12:19:50.633Z", "headline": "7 things I did to reboot my life. - Wil Wheaton - Medium", "name": "7 things I did to reboot my life. - Wil Wheaton - Medium", "description": "About twenty years ago, I had a portable spa in the back yard of my first house.

One day, the heater stopped working, so I called a repairman to come out and look at it. He told me that there would be an $85 charge no matter what, and I told him that was okay. When he got to my house, he opened up the access panel where the heater, pump, and filter lived. He looked inside, then looked back at me.</p><p>\u201cDid you try pushing the reset button?\u201d He asked.</p><p>\u201cUm. No,\u201d I said.</p><p>He pushed the reset button, and the heater came back to life.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be $85,\u201d he said. I paid him.</p><p>This post is about realizing that I was sitting in cold water, and not doing anything to turn the heater back on. This post is about how I hit the reset button.</p><p>I had this epiphany at the beginning of September: This thing that I\u2019m doing? This series of choices I make every day? It isn\u2019t working. I don\u2019t like the way I feel, I don\u2019t like the way I look, I don\u2019t like the things I\u2019m doing. Things need to change.</p><p>So I took a long, hard, serious look at myself, and concluded that some things needed to change.</p><ul><li>Drink less beer.</li><li>Read more (and Reddit does not count as reading).</li><li>Write more.</li><li>Watch more movies.</li><li>Get better sleep.</li><li>Eat better food.</li><li>Exercise more.</li></ul><p>All of these things are interconnected in ways that are probably obvious and non-obvious, and by making a commitment to do my best to accomplish these things, I\u2019ve been able to do a soft reboot of my life.</p><p>The hardest part of this was not drink less beer, which surprised me. The hardest part has been writing more. The easiest part of this has been exercise more, which also surprised me. I thought watching more movies would be easy, but it turns out that time is not a renewable resource, nor can time be stretched out in any real way that lets me get, say, four hours of movie into an hour of linear time.</p><p>In fact, if I\u2019m being honest with myself (and I have to be, because being honest with myself is the only way this is going to work; I\u2019m making major life changes here, remember), all of these things are hard to a certain degree, and that\u2019s okay, because everything worth doing is hard.</p><p>So let\u2019s go down this list and talk about each thing a little bit:</p><p>Drink less beer.</p><p>I love beer. I mean, I really love it. I brew it, I write about it, I design recipes of my own, and I\u2019ve structured entire meals around what food will pair with the beer I want to drink. The thing about beer, though, is that it\u2019s really easy to just keep on drinking it until it\u2019s all gone or your brain goes, \u201cum, hey, man, ithinkthat \u2026 imean \u2026 I mean, sorry, hold on. I th- think that youvehadneough.\u201d Excessive drinking isn\u2019t just tough on my liver (which has been a fucking CHAMP for years), it\u2019s also tough on my brain because of my Depression. It\u2019s tough on my heart, too, it turns out, because alcohol is metabolized as sugar which drives up insulin which makes my cholesterol go up which is bad for my heart thanks a lot genetics.</p><p>So I just made a commitment to drink less, drink more responsibly, and keep the intoxicating effects of the beers I love to a minimum. The first two weeks of this were really tough because I was habitually drinking two or three beers a night, but once I got used to it and broke the habit, it became as easy as I think it\u2019s going to get (and that varies from day to day).</p><p>Read more. Write more.</p><p>These go together more closely than any other things on this list. Stephen King says that writers who don\u2019t make time to read aren\u2019t going to make time to write and holy shit is that exactly, perfectly true. I need to read so that my imagination is inspired. I need to read so I get an artistic and creative hunger that can only be fed by writing. I need to read so that I feel challenged to scrape ideas out of my skull and turn them into words and images. I need to read because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to make time to write, and even though I\u2019ve had a lot of success recently as an actor and host and Guy On The Internet, all of those things are ultimately in the hands of others. I became a writer ten years ago because I not only loved it, but because it was a way for me to express myself creatively in a way that ultimately gave me control over my own destiny and my own life.</p><p>I struggled as an actor for years (it\u2019s all in my book, Just A Geek! You should buy it!) and I was doomed to a future as a Former Child Star with occasional, humiliating, soul-crushing reality TV gigs if I was lucky. But I made a choice about twelve years ago to stop chasing the big film career I always felt I deserved (and maybe would have had, if I\u2019d made different choices and had better advisers when I was younger) and start telling stories. By writing those stories and embracing the love I\u2019d always had for creative writing, I made a second act in my life (take that, F. Scott Fitzgerald!).</p><p>Now this could sound like I\u2019m complaining, or ungrateful, but I promise that isn\u2019t the case. I am totally aware that a combination of hard work, privilege, and luck have all come together for me and put me in a very good place. But I worry about things. A lot. When the night is darkest, and it seems like the sun may never rise, I worry about how long I can sustain this life. I worry about what will happen when the people who choose to hire actors decide that they don\u2019t want to hire me any more. I worry about how I\u2019ll support and provide for my family, and on and on and on.</p><p>I am profoundly and completely grateful for the success I had and continue to have, because of the hard work I did in those years. I\u2019m so lucky and grateful for the things I\u2019ve been able to do on TV, and I\u2019m really proud of the things I\u2019ve created for Geek & Sundry. But even Tabletop and Titansgrave aren\u2019t mine the same way a story I wrote is. In fact, the show I did with my name in the title was probably the least \u201cmine\u201d of anything I\u2019ve ever done, and that didn\u2019t feel particularly good at the end of the day.</p><p>But writing and storytelling always feels good. It\u2019s truly mine, whether it\u2019s awesome or shit, and nobody can take it away from me. For all of this year and most of last year, I hardly wrote anything of consequence. A few blogs, a couple of columns, and some small creative things that were always well received by the audience, sure, but never consistently and never in a way that fed the creative hunger that constantly makes my stomach growl. Going all the way back to last August, I swore that I\u2019d take more time away from other things to focus on writing and taking the pages and pages of story ideas I have in my little notebook and turning them into actual stories. The thing is, when I took that time off, my health and mana were so depleted, I couldn\u2019t find it in myself to do the work. Every few months, I\u2019d take a week or two off, and instead of writing like I wanted to, I\u2019d play video games and do nothing else, because I was just so goddamn tired. Then I would look up, realize a couple of weeks had passed, I hadn\u2019t done anything, and I needed to get back to \u201creal\u201d work. I would feel frustrated and empty, and the whole cycle would start all over again.</p><p>I\u2019ve been reading this book called The War of Art. It gets a little churchy at points, but I can skip over that and focus on the stuff that helps me: identifying all the barriers we create to give us the excuses we crave to not create. It turns out that if I were as good at sitting down and writing as I am at coming up with all the reasons I just can\u2019t do it today, I\u2019d have written ten novels this year.</p><p>So a big part of this Life Reset I\u2019m doing is being honest with myself about why I want to write, why I need to write, and why I keep making excuses for not doing it. I won\u2019t go into it, because it\u2019s either too personal or too boring, but if you\u2019re reading this and starting to have the glimmer of an epiphany about your own creative process, maybe pick up this book and check it out. It\u2019s been very helpful for me.</p><p>Yesterday, I wrote over 3000 words. I only stopped because it was time to leave for a hockey game (there\u2019s that privilege again), and I felt so goddamn good about myself when I walked out my door. I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to work today, and I\u2019m having so much fun writing this story, it may not even be fair to call it work.</p><p>Reading is an important component of this entire process for me, and making time to nourish my creative side has made a big and positive difference. Whether it\u2019s comic books, magazine articles, fiction or non-fiction, I\u2019m reading every day, and finding inspiration in everything I read.</p><p>Watch more movies.</p><p>Thanks to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, and a billion movie channels, we have access to more movies than we can ever watch, and that is amazing. Watching movies is, for me, similar to reading books. It\u2019s part homework (as an actor and writer) and part inspiration. I have the opportunity to make short films with Nerdist and Geek & Sundry, so watching movies \u2014 good movies, not disposable trash \u2014 just makes sense. It also engages my brain in creative and intellectual ways that are important. I need to watch things and feel like I can do that, too, or feel like if that thing got made, there\u2019s no reason I couldn\u2019t make one of my own things. Hell, in this room where I am right now, I have everything I need to take some sort of simple creative idea and turn it into a movie. So why not? Why not watch movies as varied as the true classics (Sunset Boulevard, Chinatown) to the weird 70s experimental (The Trip, Scorpio Rising) to the epic blockbusters (Star Wars, Jaws) and get inspired by them? This is something that I need to do, because sitting in my office all day and looking at the Internet isn\u2019t making me happier, more creative, more productive, or more inspired.</p><p>Related: listen to more podcasts like Lore, You Must Remember This, The Memory Palace, Welcome to Night Vale, The Black Tapes, and Unfictional. Those all inspire me to learn more, focus on pacing and storytelling and narrative, and make me want to be a more interesting person.</p><p>Get better sleep.</p><p>Maybe this is a strange one, but hear me out: for months \u2014 most of this year, in fact, now that I think of it \u2014 I haven\u2019t slept well. I\u2019ve had the hardest time, ever, falling asleep and staying asleep. I\u2019ve had nightmares that terrify me from the moment I finally fall asleep, well into the following day as they haunt my memories. I\u2019ve lived with the constant dread of waking up in a panic attack, and then waking up in a panic attack. It\u2019s been terrible, and has contributed tremendously to my inability to get motivated, my reliance on alcohol to relax and go to sleep at night, and a general feeling of exhaustion, laziness, pessimism, and futility. I talked with my psychiatrist about it, and we tried sleep medication, which only made my body feel tired, while my brain was still racing along at the speed of terror. After several different attempts and failures, we tried changing up my brain meds, and about six weeks ago, I finally started feeling like a human again. I won\u2019t go into the deep science of it, but we think I just had too much of some chemicals in my brain, and not enough of others. And it turns out that drinking alcohol to help you go to sleep does not result in good sleep, but does result in feeling like shit when you wake up.</p><p>So by committing to getting better sleep, I have changed up my evening and nighttime routines. I eat earlier, I drink less, I read more, and I\u2019ve been able to slowly adjust my circadian rhythm from wanting to sleep at 2am to wanting to sleep around 11pm. I\u2019ve used some great apps on my Droid to help me monitor things and determine what patterns work best for me, and while it\u2019s still a work in progress \u2014 this entire thing is a work in progress, actually \u2014 it\u2019s definitely getting better. When I don\u2019t have nightmares all goddamn night, I\u2019m more rested when I wake up. When I\u2019m rested, I feel better in every aspect of my being. When I feel better, I am more creative and more willing to allow myself to take the risk of feeling good about myself.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that strange? It\u2019s a thing that I do, that I\u2019ve done for my whole life: I don\u2019t want to take the risk of feeling good about myself, because I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll get complacent, or arrogant, or someone will discover the Truth that my Depression tells me: I\u2019m not that great and I don\u2019t deserve to feel good about myself. I\u2019m reading another book, called Trapped in the Mirror, that\u2019s really helping me get through that, though.</p><p>So I take the risk of feeling good about myself, and more often than not, I actually do feel good about myself.</p><p>Eat better.</p><p>We all say we\u2019re going to do this, and we always make excuses for why we don\u2019t. Now I\u2019ve been very lucky. My whole life, I\u2019ve been able to stay at a healthy weight and body type without much effort \u2026 then I turned 40. In the last couple of years, I gained almost 30 pounds, my cholesterol went through the roof, and my whole body began to hurt, all the time.</p><p>There\u2019s no excuse or rationalizing, here. I just wasn\u2019t taking care of myself. I wasn\u2019t eating right. I wasn\u2019t getting good nutrition. I wasn\u2019t thinking of food as fuel and nutrients. I wasn\u2019t making an effort to be smart about this, because I didn\u2019t particularly care about myself. I didn\u2019t really like myself, I didn\u2019t feel like I could do anything about getting tubby and slow and out of shape, because I was just getting older and that\u2019s the way it was.</p><p>That\u2019s all bullshit. Here\u2019s the thing, and this is pretty much the whole reason I made a choice almost three months ago to hit this reset button and really get my life together: I didn\u2019t like myself. I didn\u2019t care about myself. There\u2019s a bit more to it, but that\u2019s the two things that exist the most clearly and form the root of the last few years of my life. In fact, it took my wife, who is the most important person in my whole universe, telling me, \u201cI feel like you don\u2019t care about having a long life together with me, because you don\u2019t care about taking care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was ridiculous. Of course I cared about having a long life with her! Of course I cared \u2026 didn\u2019t I?</p><p>I cared about her, and I cared about our kids, but I didn\u2019t really care about myself. And my Depression was doing a really good job of making sure that I didn\u2019t really think about my choices and my actions affected the people I love and care about the most in this world. That was what made me look up, take my head out of the darkness, and commit to doing all of these things.</p><p>It turns out that eating well, consistently, isn\u2019t as easy as just eating what I want, when I want. It turns out that it\u2019s really hard to break out of bad habits, but it also turns out that, once I made the commitment to do that, I started feeling better almost immediately. I got an app that makes it easy to track my nutrition, calories, and exercise, and in a very short amount of time, I lost almost all the weight I\u2019d gained. I\u2019d still like to lose five more pounds, and that five pounds is really keen on sticking around, but it\u2019s slowly coming off, it\u2019s staying off, and it feels great. Also, having a digital scale that lets me track precisely how much I just pooped is probably the pinnacle of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>And a super bonus that comes with this? My body doesn\u2019t hurt like it did, because I\u2019m not schlepping around extra weight. My joints are healthy, my muscles are stronger, and my skeleton is just in better shape, and that leads me into the last part of this.</p><p>Exercise regulary.</p><p>My son, Nolan, is a personal trainer. He\u2019s in phenomenal shape, looks like Thor (for reals), and trains both me and his mom. So I should be in great shape, right?</p><p>Well, if I\u2019d stuck to a good diet, taken better care of myself, and felt like I actually deserved to feel good about myself, then yes. But as we\u2019ve seen, that just wasn\u2019t happening. I worked out a couple of times a week, I did good, hard workouts, but then I\u2019d feel sore and tired and wasn\u2019t getting the results I wanted (mostly due to poor diet) and I\u2019d come up with reasons not to do it. Then I\u2019d make the mistake of seeing myself in the mirror when I got out of the shower, and I\u2019d really hate myself.</p><p>I think that lifting weights and doing inside stuff just isn\u2019t for me. I get bored easily, and I don\u2019t fully participate in the workouts. But I love running. I used to run marathons and 5Ks all the time, and my entire self felt amazing when I did. So why not give running a try again? The excuses wrote themselves.</p><p>I was working on Con Man with Sean Astin. Sean told me about the Ironman Triathlon he was training for, and I complained that I couldn\u2019t run anymore, because my body always hurt. Sean talked to me about the diet aspect of it, and then suggested that I use a method of mixing running with walking to work myself back into shape.</p><p>So I bought an app called Zombies, Run 5K for my phone. It uses recording and all the various sensors in my phone to let me imagine that I\u2019m a runner in the zombie apocalypse. While I am being trained by a doctor, I listen to my music (Taylor Swift and Tove Lo accompany me on most of my runs) and a story unfolds in my ears. I\u2019m three weeks into the training, and while it\u2019s starting to ramp up from challenging to difficult, it feels great. I look forward to every run, I challenge myself to go as hard and as long as I can (that\u2019s what she said) and the benefits to my self-esteem, my physical and mental health, and overall quality of life are incredible. If I was looking to quantify the value of this, it would probably be like spending five bucks to get ten thousand dollars of awesome. (Does that make sense? I\u2019ve been writing this for a long time and the words are starting to get blurry on the screen).</p><p>I deserve to be happy. I deserve to feel good about myself. I can do the work that I need to do to accomplish these things.</p><p>If I tried to do just one of these things, and I stayed committed to it, I\u2019d probably feel better about myself. Doing all of them together isn\u2019t necessarily easier, but it isn\u2019t necessarily harder, either. Every one of these things supports the other in a sparkling geometric structure of awesome that is making my life significantly and consistently better.</p><p>I just did a word count on this, and I\u2019m at nearly 3500 words. I didn\u2019t intend to write this much, and I suspect that most people will tl;dr it, but I\u2019m glad that I spent the time thinking about these things and writing them down like this. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll revisit this, rewrite it, and revise it, but I\u2019m going to publish it now without a lot of editing. This is raw, and I feel like it\u2019s supposed to be.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Productivity", "Lifehacks"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*B1y4oOeYoZpXxfXT8NU7rg.jpeg"], "url": "https://medium.com/@learngirl/iron-supplements-explained-61c1ce570313", "dateCreated": "2015-02-28T15:46:27.217Z", "datePublished": "2015-02-28T15:46:27.217Z", "dateModified": "2018-06-20T18:51:06.222Z", "headline": "I need more iron - zawadi - Medium", "name": "I need more iron - zawadi - Medium", "description": "During my search for answers on why I\u2018m not getting enough and what the difference is between supplements, I was frustrated at the lack of clear answers.

The main ones being physical and mental fatigue that comes from not having enough iron, the crucial ingredient for dna, dopamine, white blood cells and hemoglobin for oxygen transport. It likely affects kids development and can have particularly negative consequences if you\u2019re pregnant.</p><p>Iron overload however can be worse.</p><p>Iron can be a reactive little element when it isn\u2019t properly bound, and can release free radicals which cause oxidative stress to tissues. For this reason our body tries to keep iron locked up in a stable form, however if we increase iron too quickly or over time saturate our normal ways of dealing with it then we end up with iron overload. Excess iron is stored in our organs, so long periods of high iron can cause nasty things like liver and pancreas damage, heart disease and reproductive problems. The people most at risk of iron overload are people with the genetic disorder hemochromatosis. This disorder causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet and it is fairly common if you\u2019re of Northern European ancestry \u2014 like 1 in every 200\u2013300 people. Without this disease you\u2019re not that likely to overload from food, but it can happen through accidental overdosing on iron supplements. Children are especially at risk of this.</p><p>Increased risk of infection</p><p>There is another thing to be aware of with iron. As much as we need iron to grow, so do microorganisms. People with a lot of free iron floating around are generally more susceptible to bacterial infections and other related diseases like diabetes, Alzeheimer\u2019s and multiple sclerosis.</p><h1>So get tested</h1><p>Both iron deficiency and overload can make you tired (as well as lots of other things) so self diagnosis is definitely not recommended. The test is a simple blood test. The lab will indicate the healthy range, but here\u2019s what the different measurements mean.</p><h2>Ferritin</h2><p>Only a fraction of the ferritin in your body is in the blood, but measuring this ferritin gives a good indication of your overall iron storage. Ferritin is the first iron to deplete so it\u2018s the early warning sign of iron deficiency.</p><p>There are tester kits (1, 2) on the market where you can check your own ferritin levels.</p><h2>Serum iron</h2><p>The amount of iron attached to transferrin is an indicator of how much iron is in your body. As well as measuring the serum iron, usually another test is done to check that transferrin is working properly (TIBC or direct transferrin test). Using these two tests you\u2019re given Transferrin Saturation(TS)%.</p><h2>Hemoglobin (Hb)</h2><p>This measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood which is needed to transport oxygen around the body. Low Hb is the final stage of iron deficiency and is an indicator for anemia. Low iron isn\u2019t the only thing that causes anemia, which is why all the tests are needed for the full picture.</p><h1>Choosing sources of iron</h1><p>There are two factors that make up how much iron you\u2019re getting:</p><p>It\u2019s not so hard finding the iron content of things but determining bioavailability is a challenge.</p><h1>Bioavailability of food</h1><p>With all that uncertainty I guess it\u2019s not surprising that there are so few figures on the bioavailability of iron in food. One figure bandied about is the bioavailability of heme iron which is often given as 10\u201335% . Note that heme makes up only part of the iron in meat and cooking and freezing can further reduce the heme.</p><a>here</a><p>Plants contain only non-heme iron but aren\u2019t any easier to figure out. In general they have a lower bioavailability than meat at somewhere between 1\u201315%. A difference of up to 15 times is quite a lot, and it\u2019s due to the large effects of enhancers, inhibitors and cooking.</p><h1>Enhancers</h1><p>The plant food types that have high bioavailaiblity are generally the ones that contain high amounts of natural acids. Ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C) is the most effective enhancer, which helps iron by protecting the iron from inhibitors, keeping it soluble and in the ferrous state. Other natural acids like citric, malic, tartaric and lactic acid also enhance iron but to a lesser extent. How much acid is needed is often given as 20mg ascorbic acid for 3mg of iron, but that\u2019s provided there aren\u2019t too many inhibitors. With high amounts of inhibitors then double that is needed.</p><p>The acids don\u2019t help heme iron get absorbed, however meat tissue enhances all types of iron. This \u2018meat factor\u2019 isn\u2019t fully understood, but its enhancing effect is less than ascorbic. One study found the effects of 30g muscle tissue to be equivalent to 25 mg ascorbic. These two enhancers aren\u2019t additive, so if iron has been fully enhanced by acid, meat can\u2019t enhance it further.</p><p>Reference doc for enhancers</p><h1>Inhibitors</h1><p>Inhibitors form a compound with iron that stops it getting absorbed. Phytate is the main inhibitor of plant food which is found mostly in legumes and cereal grains. A bit annoying seeing as legumes are especially high in iron. Preparations like soaking, sprouting and fermenting can greatly reduce the phytate content and therefore increase their bioavailability.</p><p>Polyphenols (used to be called vegetable tannins) are another category of inhibitors. They\u2019re found in lots of tasty things like teas, coffee, red wine and cocoa. There are different types of polyphenols with different inhibitory strength, for example tea polyphenols inhibit more than coffee or wine ones.</p><p>Certain proteins like whey and casein found in milk, and egg proteins inhibit non-heme iron. The protein in soy beans has also been found to inhibit iron.</p><p>The last inhibitor usually cited is calcium, which unlike the others affects both heme and non-heme iron. There is debate around how much calcium affects iron directly, and how much it affects it by blocking phytates from releasing or due to the proteins it\u2019s often taken with. So at this stage it\u2019s a maybe.</p><p>Reference doc for inhibitors</p><h1>Comparing iron supplements</h1><p>Looking for ways to get all your iron needs from food is ideal, but if it\u2019s not happening for you or you need a quick boost then supplements are a proven option. Comparing the bioavailability of supplements is a lot more difficult than I anticipated. In addition to all the problems with measuring bioavailability listed above, supplements don\u2019t require any clinical trials to test their effectiveness. There is so little relevant data especially on the newer iron types.</p><p>Rather than skip this important comparison, I\u2019ve put the data I found into a best approximation. So treat this as such and check out my source documents if you\u2019d like to see what clinical trials were used. Throughout I\u2019m always comparing the elemental weight of iron in each supplment. This is the weight of Fe, not the weight of the whole compound.</p><a>price and toxicity</a><h1>Ferrous sulfate (FS)</h1><p>Ferrous sulfate (also spelt sulphate) is the most common iron supplement, and for good reason. It\u2019s very soluble so it\u2019s fast working, it has good bioavailability and is the cheapest form. When overall bioavailability has been measured for ferrous sulphate it seems around the 20% mark, but going up towards 40% for anemic people and with enhancers, and towards zero for people with sufficient iron and inhibitors present. Most studies use relative bioavailability (RBV) as a measurement in order to cancel out some of the fluctuations, in which case sulfate is the reference and is set at 100%.</p><p>The usual complaint with sulfate is due to it being quite reactive. Like all the ferrous salts it\u2019s mostly fine at low doses, but at high amounts it may cause stomach irritation. Taking it with food can lessen the irritation but this isn\u2019t recommended because of the wide range of inhibitors that affect it. Instead smaller doses more often, or a smaller dose with enhancers seems to be the way to go. Another thing to keep in mind is its higher toxicity. This is generally fine for adults, but a fair amount of children each year are poisoned by accidental iron overdose.</p><p>Reference doc for ferrous sulfate</p><h1>Ferrous gluconate</h1><p>Ferrous gluconate is a soluble iron salt that seems to be less bioavailable than ferrous sulfate but not by much \u2014 like around 90% of sulfate levels. When comparing the same dose, there weren\u2019t any reported differences in side effects between gluconate and sulfate. Supplement doses tend to be smaller in gluconate though, which could be why it is viewed as gentler on the stomach. Especially in formulations like Floradix which people talk about being gentle on the stomach, the amount of gluconate is only 10mg per serving. Like the other iron salts, gluconate is prone to the effects of enhancers and inhibitors so care needs to be taken with what it\u2019s consumed with.</p><p>Reference doc for ferrous gluconate</p><h1>Ferrous fumarate</h1><p>Ferrous fumarate is the least soluble out of these ferrous salts. This means it\u2019s a little more reliant on gastric acid to dissolve and takes a little longer to absorb. Ferrous fumarate is often referred to as having less bioavailability than sulfate and gentler on the stomach. This makes sense due to its lower solubility, but I haven\u2019t found the studies to back that up. Most rate its bioavailability and side effects the same as sulfate. Inhibitors and enhancers affect it, but one thing to note is that unlike sulfate, it isn\u2019t enhanced by Na2EDTA. Na2EDTA is often added to processed foods to stop oxidation, so that\u2019s one source of enhancers that fumarate misses out on.</p><p>Reference doc for ferrous fumarate</p><h1>Ferrous succinate</h1><p>There aren\u2019t many studies on this iron salt despite it being around in the 50\u2019s, so I left it off the chart but it\u2019s worth a mention. It tends to get used in combination supplements rather than on it\u2019s own which might have to do to with its fairly low solubility. One study put its bioavailability relative to sulfate as 92% in tablet, and 122% in liquid. So pretty good and maybe more bioavailable than sulfate in liquid form. The problem is the lack of information on it. People report it as being gentler on the stomach compared to sulfate which makes sense for a less soluble form, but I haven\u2019t seen any data to back that up.</p><h1>Ferrous bis-glycine chelate (FeBC)</h1><p>FeBC is a type of iron amino acid chelate with a structure of one molecule of iron bound by two molecules of glycine. There are other types of iron amino acid chelates but FeBC is the main one, often going by the brand name of Ferrochel\u00ae. It\u2019s a very soluble and stable form of iron, so compared to sulfate it\u2019s less likely to cause irritation during digestion. It is still affected by inhibitors, but this is estimated at about half as much as sulfate. Most studies conclude its bioavailability is the same as sulfate either at the same dose or at half the dose. Not sure why the lower does the same job, but it implies that it could have a higher bioavailability. It needs more studies to confirm this.</p><p>Reference doc for FeBC</p><h1>Ferritin</h1><p>Ferritin is what we and nearly all organisms use to store iron. It\u2019s a protein with an \u201ciron core\u201d of up to 4500 ferric iron molecules inside. Although ferritin can come from both plant and animal sources, bovine ferritin is what is used most in studies. The number of ferric molecules inside ferritin can vary, and animal sources tend to have higher concentrations compared to plant sources. It was originally thought that all the ferritin we consume is absorbed in the normal non-heme way, where the protein opens up during digestion and the ferric iron is released. Many studies have now shown that as well as this method of absorption it also has its own pathway where it can get absorbed into intestinal cells whole. Which of these two pathways ferritin takes seems to depend on the conditions of the stomach such as gastric acids and stomach pH. If the ferritin stays whole through digestion then inhibitors don\u2019t affect it. Unlike all other non-heme iron, ascorbic acid seems to have a negative effect on it unless it is enteric coated.</p><p>There is a bit of a divide with studies measuring the bioavailability of ferritin. Older studies that use extrinsic labeling put the bioavailability quite low. Newer studies use intrinsic labeling which claim to be more accurate, and show that ferritin has the same bioavailability as ferrous sulfate. So ferritin seems like it could be a pretty good source of iron, but there are few commercial supplements of it. Infact I could only find one expensive product that has little information about it. How this supplement compares to ferritin in existing studies is unknown. In terms of side effects, there are few studies on it but it is generally considered to have low side effects which makes sense due to its stable structure and naturally slow release.</p><p>Reference doc for ferritin</p><h1>Iron Protein Succinylate (IPS)</h1><p>IPS (sometimes called ITF282) is a form of ferric iron bound to milk protein. This protein casing protects it from being solubilised in the stomach, and instead it opens up in the intestines. This translates into good tolerability, and studies tend to put it at around half the side effects of sulfate. In terms of its bioavailability, it\u2019s generally put at a little less than ferrous sulfate. Interestingly, a couple of studies show it overtaking sulfate in effectiveness after prolonged use. It is speculated that this could be because it causes less irritation, which is known to inhibit future absorption. There\u2019s not much information about how it\u2019s affected by inhibitors and enhancers, but it would make sense that it would be affected less while in the stomach, and when the ferric iron has been released it would be acted on in the usual way.</p><p>Reference doc for IPS</p><h1>Polysaccharide Iron Complex (PIC)</h1><p>There are different types of PIC, but generally this complex is made from a carbohydrate and ferric iron. Like the other larger synthetic complexes, the idea is that the carbohydrate stabilizes the iron while it\u2019s in the stomach so it is less likely to react and cause irritation. Once in the small intestines it releases the ferric iron so it can be converted to ferrous iron and absorbed. That\u2019s the idea, but it\u2019s hard to say how well it does this due to a lack of good studies on it. It appears that its bioavailability is a bit less than ferrous sulfate and that it has less negative side effects. There\u2019s not much information on the enhancers and inhibitors, but it seems like they affect it a bit less than sulfate.</p><p>Reference doc for PIC</p><h1>Carbonyl</h1><p>Carbonyl is a highly purified form of iron. The difference between it and other elemental iron powders isn\u2019t the iron but rather the manufacturing process and in particular the size of iron particles. Carbonyl is the most bioavailable of all the iron powders, but when compared against ferrous sulfate it is generally considered around 75% as bioavailable. Carbonyl needs stomach gastric acids to solubilize it before it can be absorbed which makes it quite susceptible to the negative effects of food. Wheat especially seems to decimate its absorption. This requirement of gastric acids means that it is naturally slowly released, which makes it very safe and also translates into low gastro side effects.</p><p>In studies for children it seems to do a bit better than adults, which is probably due to the smaller dose and/or differences in gastric acids. As well as the safety aspect, another feature that could make it appealing as a choice for children is the small pill size and its availability in a chewable form.</p><p>Reference doc for carbonyl</p><h1>Heme Iron peptide (HIP)</h1><p>HIP is classified as a medical food rather than a supplement, but I think it\u2019s worth lumping it with the rest for comparison. The heme iron in HIP generally comes from bovine hemoglobin, although it is possible to get heme iron from plant sources like soy. Unlike all the other supplements, it gets absorbed through the heme pathway which means that it stays whole through digestion and isn\u2019t affected by most of the enhancers and inhibitors. Its only enhancer is meat tissue, and it is possibly inhibited by calcium. Because HIP isn\u2019t that affected by inhibitors, it\u2019s easy to get wildly different results when comparing it against other supplements depending on what food it\u2019s taken with. From looking at the small selection of studies on it, I\u2019d put it about twice as bioavailable as ferrous sulfate but that\u2019s just a best guess. So HIP seems to be an effective supplement with the flexibility of being able to be taken with food and with low levels of side effects. The negatives are that it\u2019s expensive and there is a lack of studies on the commercial HIP products. They may perform differently to the HIP in the studies.</p><p>Reference doc for HIP</p><h1>Intravenous iron (IV)</h1><p>I really wanted to add intravenous iron to the chart but it wouldn\u2019t quite squish into the same comparison categories. IV isn\u2019t a type of iron but rather the method of injecting iron directly into the blood stream. This has the bonus of bypassing the whole gastric system, so in terms of gastric side effects it\u2019s about zero. Bioavailability is really high because it\u2019s absorbed straight into the bloodstream and therefore it also can\u2019t react with any food.</p><p>Sounds pretty awesome except like everything there are some big downsides. One, as mentioned previously is the risk of having too much iron floating around in your body. This risk doesn\u2019t seem too high if you\u2019re low on iron and without a high risk of infection, but we don\u2019t fully know what effects there could be from big spikes in our bodies iron levels. As a precaution it is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>The other big downside is the price to adminster and the cost of the iron formulae. The price of administering IV iron is coming down due to advances in IV iron formulas. Older types were suitable only for multiple small dose injections or else large dose infusions that needed a lengthy hospital visit. Newer formulas can be given by one quick high dose injection from your GP. The other side of price is the cost of the iron formula, which is surprisingly high. The newer formulas that are easier to administer seem to be priced in the $US 80\u2013300 mark for 1,000mg of iron. It doesn\u2019t seem like an efficient way of tackling iron deficiency except for urgent cases or patients that aren\u2019t responding to other methods. That could change though if prices come down.</p><p>Reference doc for IV iron</p><h1>Lactoferrin</h1><p>Lactoferrin is an interesting protein and worth a mention because it has been shown to increase iron levels. It\u2019s primarily found in human milk but there is also a similar version of it in cows\u2019 milk. It can bind strongly to two molecules of ferric iron and has a direct pathway into our intestinal cells in a similar way that heme and ferritin does. It also has extremely low side effects, so you\u2019d think it would be a good iron supplement but there is more to it. Seeing as it strongly attracts iron, if we take it in its depleted form then rather than give us iron it can scavenge iron from our bodies. This can be a good thing because it can take free iron away from bacteria. In fact this is one of the great things about lactoferrin, it has been shown to have lots of anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The debate around lactoferrin is whether the increase in iron levels that we see (about the same increase as ferrous sulfate) is due to lactoferrin giving iron or its ability to reduce inflammation. It seems like it\u2019s more to do with its anti-bacterial properties and generally it\u2019s recommended not to be taken by itself for iron deficiency but possibly with other iron. Most lactoferrin supplements are in the depleted iron form, so potentially if you could get it in its iron bound form it could increase iron but more studies are required. For those susceptible to iron overload, it could be worth looking into.</p><p>Reference doc for lactoferrin</p><h1>Related supplement stuff</h1><h1>Slow release tablets</h1><p>Slow release tablets generally refer to an enteric coating which keeps the tablet together in the acidic conditions of the stomach and then breaks down in the non-acidic intestines. Sounds good in theory but not so impressive in studies. The main slow release iron that has been tested is ferrous sulfate. The general consensus is that it may be gentler on the stomach, but this is due to not all of the iron getting released in time. So basically you\u2019re getting less iron and may as well just take a smaller dose of normal ferrous sulfate and save yourself some money. The UK health board recommend that the NHS don\u2019t prescribe it and the following in-vitro study put the bioavailability of Ferrograd C at 71% of normal ferrous sulfate. That\u2019s pretty low considering Ferrograd C as well as being enteric coated has the enhancer ascorbic acid too.</p><h1>Cast iron pans</h1><p>Cooking in cast iron pans has been proven in several studies (1)(2) to increase iron levels for those that eat from it. Rather than comparing it against other supplements they compare it against other types of pans so it\u2019s hard to know how it stacks up to ferrous sulfate, but the increases in Hb and ferritin make it seem equivalent to a low dose supplement. It is especially effective when acidic foods are cooked in it. Foods with little acidity like legumes it doesn\u2019t do much for.</p><h1>Iron-rich water</h1><p>A similar idea to cast iron pans is iron-rich water like the type Spatone\u00ae sell. The only studies I can find on it are the three that Spatone have paid for. All three have small sample sizes and don\u2019t compare it against another type of iron. I\u2019ve read enough trials to know that this isn\u2019t normal practice. A Spatone sachet contains a tiny 5mg of ferrous sulfate at a high cost. I have no doubt that they\u2019re gentle on the stomach considering the small amount of iron in them, I\u2019m just unconvinced that they\u2019re any different than taking small amounts of ferrous sulfate which is a very soluble form of iron anyway. Until a proper trial is done, money might be better spent making your own iron water with one of these fishies.</p><h1>iron fortification</h1><p>If you\u2019re wondering what type of iron is added to food as fortification, the answer is it could be one of many like ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferric pyrophosphate, and electrolytic iron powders. While bioavailability and side effects are most important for supplements, iron for fortification has the priority of not discoloring or causing rancidity to the food. For this reason fortification iron tends to be less soluble unless it\u2019s going into dry goods with a quick turnover. Less soluble iron usually means less bioavailability however, and often cheap elemental iron powders are used which the WHO don\u2019t recommend due to their low bioavailability. If you want to check out the iron that the WHO recommend for different products see their list in the link above.</p><h1>But why are so many people low in iron?</h1><p>Surprisingly this key question seems to have the least amount of research on it. Putting global iron deficiency down to things like plant based diets, pregnancy, menstruation and childrens growth seems simplistic. We\u2019ve been doing those things a long time, have we always been iron deficient? Here are a couple of my thoughts.</p><h2>Diet</h2><p>The food we eat may have less iron then in the past. Articles like this one talk about soil depletion and the use of fast growing varieties that have less time to acquire minerals and vitamins. Also the way we eat food is a likely contributor. Processing, cooking and storing food destroys good iron enhancing acids. Even more reason to add more fresh and raw foods to the diet.</p><h2>Inflammation & stress</h2><p>It\u2019s well known that certain chronic diseases trigger inflammation which reduce our iron absorption. We do this as a defence mechanism in order to stop harmful micro-organisms from using the iron themselves. Inflammation can happen without chronic disease too. One third of people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suffer from anemia. So inflammation of various kinds can stop us absorbing iron. Many studies show the link between stress and IBS and other forms of inflammation. So all the links are there, but somehow stress is seldom discussed in relation to iron deficiency. Maybe it comes down to the gapping hole in the health system when it comes to dealing with the mind, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a valid area to look into for your own answers.</p><h1>Final word</h1><p>The first line of this story was true at the start of my research but I\u2018m not low in iron anymore. That doesn\u2019t mean I have all the answers, just that I\u2019ve found what works for me. If I had to sum up my thoughts i\u2019d say:</p><ul><li>Being low in iron is crap, and supplements do work. If you decide to use them to boost your iron then don\u2019t worry too much about the type, but instead focus on a dose that works for you and what you take it with.</li><li>Once you\u2019re feeling better, try to figure out the reason you\u2019re low. As well as any cause your doctor suggests, diet, inflammation, and stress are good areas to look into.</li></ul><p>A personal project by zawadi.

A vague, foreboding sense that you were wasting your life, that you weren\u2019t doing \u201creal work.\u201d A nagging need to HELP PEOPLE; to be spiritually useful, somehow. This is what drew you to nursing, what called you to the field.</p><p>Still, you feel vaguely naked and vulnerable at work, as if having accidentally showed up to your old office job in your pajamas. Your scrubs still feel a bit like a Halloween costume, and perhaps always will. You can be seen most days wandering around the unit with a bag of labs in your hand, a look of confusion draped across your face, as if to say, \u201cWhat do I do with these?

Maybe it\u2019s that 60-year-old mother of four who you helped die with dignity, or coaching her family through what was likely the worst crisis of their lives.

No one really knows what you\u2019re doing here, or where you came from, whether you\u2019re part of some weird, covert government experiment. Years of working in a high-stress, high-volume profession have deformed you into a person indistinguishable from the rest of the human species. You have odd, unsettling hobbies outside of work \u2014 things like animal husbandry, or blogging about how the moon is a hologram projected into the sky by agents of the Illuminati. You are a poor historian, prone to trite, silly fabrications, like that you\u2019re a third-degree blackbelt, or had stigmata as a child. You once claimed that you\u2019d never consumed \u2014 or even heard of! \u2014 an avocado. You said this while dipping nachos into a big bowl of guacamole. No one dared refute you.</p><p>Strangely, you know your shit when it comes to patient care. Even the War Horse would concede this. All of which serves to make you that much more intimidating to newer nurses. You are not so much a bully as a monstrous, malevolent, all-knowing presence on the unit. People actually schedule their shifts so as to not coincide with yours. Your continued employment appears to be the result of you having something incriminating on the higher-ups at the hospital. Also, you have a near-encyclopedic knowledge of the methodologies of various serial killers, and you sometimes enjoy sneaking these dark factoids into your shift reports. You are bat-shit crazy.

When I wrote up a few impressions one week later, I said:</p><p>I\u2019m only a week into this adventure, and I also have another hip to do in a few months, so it would be silly to sum things up at this point. I have much more to learn and experience, and I\u2019ll write more as the process goes forward.</p><p>That time has come. I\u2019ve recovered from the first surgery, and on Monday of this week I had the same type of hip replacement surgery on the left side. I\u2019ve learned and experienced a lot in the last 12 weeks, so I\u2019m going to share some impressions now from a slightly more informed perspective.</p><p>To be clear, I\u2019m no expert on this topic. I\u2019m just a guy who has had both hips replaced. My recovery from the first one went very well \u2014 my surgeon and physical therapist said I recovered faster than most patients, and apparently I spent more time on the details than the average patient does, but I\u2019ll never know whether the two are related or I\u2019m just lucky.</p><p>As before, I wrote this up mostly for friends who are considering hip replacement or have a good chance of it in their future. Mine have come a little earlier than average, so I seem to know more people anticipating this procedure than people who\u2019ve already done it. If your hips are rock-solid and you\u2019re well under 50, this article isn\u2019t intended for you and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be offended if you don\u2019t bother to read it.</p><h2>Knowing What to Expect</h2><p>It\u2019s nice to have been through this once, so now I know generally what to expect. To recap, here\u2019s how it went the first time around \u2026</p><p>After a few days, the more intensive PT (physical therapy) began. It\u2019s mostly about learning to walk without a limp, and your muscles need to get stronger to make up for various changes. You need to accomplish these goals while adhering to a set of hip restrictions such as not crossing your legs or bending more than 90 degrees at the waist for a few weeks (or longer in some cases).</p><p>I should point out that there are many different ways to do a hip replacement, and I\u2019ve had the posterior approach both times, so I\u2019ve been working through the specific issues involved in recovering from that procedure.</p><p>There is also an anterior approach where the surgeon comes in through the front of the leg, and if you\u2019re interested in that debate you can find online many passionate opinions from orthopedic surgeons and patients regarding the differences. At the risk of generalizing about a topic I don\u2019t fully understand, it seems that fans of the anterior approach talk about how short the recovery time is, and surgeons who prefer the posterior approach like the extra visibility they have when installing the new hip from that angle. My surgeon Dr. Bruckner only does posterior replacements, and that\u2019s good enough for me: I chose a surgeon, not a surgery, and I\u2019m comfortable with him making those decisions, given his track record.</p><p>After three weeks, I was to the point where most of my PT time was just walking, sometimes with Nordic walking poles and sometimes without. I completed the Microsoft 5K with Nordic poles on Day 30, which felt good as a milestone.</p><p>After that, it was just a matter of getting clearance from the surgeon to lift all hip restrictions at the 6-week mark, and life returned to normal. Here\u2019s a graphical representation of key milestones during those six weeks as recorded in my journal:</p><p>For hip #2, I had the same hospital stay (two days), but I\u2019ve already had a good night\u2019s sleep on Day 3 instead of Day 4. It\u2019s early, but I feel like this recovery will go faster, both because I already know the drill and also due to a couple of the changes covered below.</p><h2>The Constants</h2><p>First, a few things that didn\u2019t change. Many details of my two hip surgeries stayed exactly the same.</p><a></a><p>Most notably, I had same orthopedic surgeon both times, Dr. James Bruckner of Proliance. He\u2019s so popular that you have to wait to get in to see him (I had to wait over two months for the initial consultation), but I highly recommend him. As I said after my first surgery, \u201cI like Dr. Bruckner\u2019s style and that of every member of his team I\u2019ve dealt with: they\u2019re sharp, alert, consistently positive without being pollyannish, and extremely well-organized.\u201d It was exactly the same experience the second time.</p><p>Some of the Overlake Hospital staff members I met after my first surgery were also there for my second one. For example, It was comforting to start the day with a familiar face and personality: John the pre-op RN with curly silver hair, long goatee, and a big purple-handled comb in the back pocket of his scrubs. He got me prepped, including details such as the dots on my feet where they would check my pulse after surgery and a big blanket with an attached tube gently blowing warm air on me \u2014 studies have found that you\u2019re less likely to get an infection when you\u2019re nice and warm. John has a quick smile and the calm, steady demeanor of a guy who\u2019s seen it all.</p><p>Once I got back to my room after the surgery, I ran into a few more familiar faces.</p><p>Tom, the tall daytime RN with a Type 1 diabetes bracelet tattooed on his wrist, gently pushed me both times to take enough Oxycodone to stay ahead of the pain curve. He may have accurately surmised that I have a tendency to not take pain management seriously (pain meds are for wimps!), and in fact on the first night of hip #2 I definitely got \u201cbehind the curve\u201d for a while, but Tom helped me get back on track in the morning.</p><p>Patrick, a tech (nurse\u2019s assistant) who works night shift, is a model of efficiency. He has mastered the subtle art of moving quickly at all times without ever seeming brusque or impatient. The perfect guy to show up at 2AM when you really need to pee \u2014 he\u2019s gone before you realize you\u2019re done.</p><p>Nick \u201cthe vampire\u201d as I called him (and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the only one) has a very specialized role each morning. He visits all of the post-surgery patients in the orthopedic ward at 4:30AM to take blood samples, so that when Dr. Bruckner and his PA make their daily rounds at 6:00AM they will have the latest blood test info for every patient. I\u2019ve had blood drawn countless times during all the appointments related to these surgeries the last few months, and Nick can draw two vials and tape a cotton swab over the hole before most people can find a good vein. He works 12 hour shifts, 7 days on and 7 days off, and Wednesday is the end of his week. I told him to enjoy his 7 days off as he rushed out of my room yesterday morning, and he laughed and said \u201cit won\u2019t be a full 7 full days, they always call.\u201d</p><p>It was great to see these guys. They all felt like old friends after working with them for a few days less than three months ago.</p><h2>The Changes</h2><p>Many details were different this time around, and the biggest difference was the change in anesthesia protocol. For hip #1, my anesthesiologist Dr. James Larson administered a general anesthesia with a morphine-based epidural pain killer. That was the approach Bruckner\u2019s team was recommending for hip replacements at that time.</p><p>But in the weeks since then, they\u2019ve changed their approach. For hip #2 anesthesiologist Kevin Fujinaga recommended a bupivacaine spinal instead of general anesthesia. He said they\u2019ve found that most patients recover more quickly that way, with less nausea and other symptoms.</p><p>I hesitated at first \u2014 I\u2019ve heard of the sawing and pounding that goes into a posterior hip replacement (hell, they start by deliberately dislocating the old hip), and I sure didn\u2019t want to be awake for any of that! Kevin explained that I would be \u201cdeeply sedated\u201d instead of unconscious, a distinction without a difference in most cases.</p><p>I said sure, let\u2019s go for it, and as it turned out everything was fine. The only thing I remember hearing during the surgery was a snippet of conversation about the Seahawks-49ers game the day before, and it seems likely that was in the recovery room.</p><p>There are several differences between the bupivicaine experience and the general anesthesia experience, some positive and some slightly negative, but overall I much preferred this approach. If I ever need a similar surgery in the future, I\u2019d want the bupivicaine spinal.</p><p>It was clear as soon as I came to in the recovery room that this time was different. I was alert and clear-headed, whereas after the general/morphine approach I was very foggy for a long time. Here are a few other differences that became clear that first day:</p><ul><li>Less pain relief. The morphine with the general anesthesia had stayed in my system for many hours, but I was starting to feel the pain of the incision within 4 hours this time, so I started taking Oxycodone then.</li><li>First walk sooner, but more pain. With the morphine, I was too dizzy to risk walking until a full 18 hours after surgery. With the bupivicaine, my head was clear and I took a good walk at the 8-hour mark, but even with the maximum dose of Oxycodone I felt it more than the first walk after hip #1.</li><li>Appetite returned much faster. With the morphine I didn\u2019t really eat an entire meal until two days after the surgery, and I\u2019m not one to lose my appetite easily. With the bupivicaine, I enjoyed a bowl of chicken soup and some pasta just 6 hours after surgery, and finished it quickly because I was hungry.</li></ul><p>When I saw Kevin the day after surgery, I told him I much preferred the bupivicaine spinal, and he said \u201cfor the right person, this approach seems to work great.\u201d The physical therapists on my floor had similar comments as well. Apparently some people prefer the morphine. But I\u2019m glad to have a little less pain control (which can be remedied for the most part with other meds) rather than spend two days feeling stoned and groggy.</p><p>A few other differences this time around worth noting:</p><ul><li>I\u2019m not on a blood thinner this time! I love this \u2014 it\u2019s stressful to take Coumadin (warfarin) for a month. You have to be very careful with your diet, you have to go into the \u201canti-coagulation clinic\u201d twice a week to get an INR test, and if you bang you head you need to call 911 right away before the swelling grows so quickly that you\u2019ll pass out or worse. Instead, the strategy for minimizing risk of blood clots this time is to take aspirin twice a day and stay very active (which I like).</li><li>I have a waterproof Aquacel dressing this time, so can take a shower any time. I just did a sponge bath when I got home last night, but it\u2019s nice to know I don\u2019t have to do that for two full weeks.</li><li>This one\u2019s self-inflicted, but I gave in and got a temporary handicapped parking permit this time. Last time I didn\u2019t bother, thinking that it would be good for my recovery to walk further any time I needed to park and walk into a building, but that was when it was warm and sunny. I\u2019m guessing there may be cold rainy days ahead when I won\u2019t be too proud to park in a handicapped spot.</li><li>And here\u2019s a difference I think I forgot to mention in the first draft of this post because it\u2019s something so unpleasant that I\u2019ve successfully repressed my memory of it the first time around: due to the lack of general anesthesia, there was no urinary catheter this time! The removal of that catheter is my most disturbing memory of the first hip replacement.</li></ul><p>A funny story about that last detail: on the final day of surgery #2, I passed the nurse\u2019s station and had an immediate visceral reaction to a woman standing there. It took a second to remember how I knew her. She was the tech who had removed my catheter, and the sight of her scares me. :)</p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>Surgical procedures are evolving quickly, and I wasn\u2019t expecting to see so much change in just 12 weeks, especially considering it was the same team at the same hospital. But it presents an opportunity to recover even faster and get even stronger, and I\u2019m planning to take advantage of that opportunity. Let\u2019s do it, Jamie!</p><p>UPDATE: after the final surgeon follow-up six weeks later, I wrote up a few final thoughts in Cleared For Takeoff.</p>", "tags": ["Surgery", "Health", "Hip Replacement"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*rmsoIeSyOT9SefRxOvthLA.jpeg"], "url": "https://medium.com/digital-nomad-stories/the-cult-of-work-you-never-meant-to-join-cd965fb9ea1a", "dateCreated": "2015-04-15T12:40:33.623Z", "datePublished": "2015-04-15T12:40:33.623Z", "dateModified": "2018-05-25T17:44:02.370Z", "headline": "The Cult of Work You Never Meant to Join - This Publication is Moved - Medium", "name": "The Cult of Work You Never Meant to Join - This Publication is Moved - Medium", "description": "It all started with a chance to earn a living doing something you loved.

You\u2019ve been lured into the Overkill Cult.</p><p>The Overkill Cult is a cultural delusion that working 60+ hours each week \u2014 at the expense of everything else in our lives \u2014 is not only a necessary part of success, but that doing so is somehow honorable.</p><p>The insidious thing about the Overkill Cult is that it masquerades as all the things we like most about ourselves: dedication, ambition, follow-through, responsibility.</p><p>It tells us to push harder, stay later, sleep when we\u2019re dead. It tells us we\u2019re never going to get ahead if we don\u2019t show up first and go home last.</p><p>Cleverly, wickedly, the Overkill Cult persuades us to hang ourselves with our own strengths.</p><p>And if we don\u2019t break free, we\u2019re all going to die.</p><h1>The Overkill Cult Will Kill You (Like It Tried to Kill Me)</h1><p>Balance is the first thing to go once the Overkill Cult has us in its grasp.</p><p>For me, it started with my health. I skipped the gym \u2014 too busy, I thought. I didn\u2019t have time to cook \u2014 too busy \u2014 so I ordered delivery.</p><p>My hobbies went next. Everything that wasn\u2019t work fell away \u2014 too busy, too busy \u2014 until I was on the computer constantly, working. In 2012, I was working 70\u201390 hours a week.</p><p>After that, I lost my social life. Friends knew I wouldn\u2019t show up \u2014 can\u2019t; too busy \u2014 so they stopped calling. Some days my only human interaction was ordering coffee.</p><p>Then \u2014 and this, sadly, is where I finally realized there was a problem \u2014 I lost my beard.</p><h1>The Canary in the Coal Mine, or How I Killed My Beard</h1><p>At the end of 2012, I landed the biggest project of my career at that point: a Black Friday sales site for a Fortune 100 company.</p><p>I was thrilled and terrified. A project like this had the potential to move my company to the next level, and I decided to do whatever it took to make this project the best I\u2019d ever built.</p><p>The designers had great ideas, and I sat with them to make sure they were possible on our timeline. We came up with a slick, modern idea built on cutting-edge technology. The client loved it.</p><p>Then bureaucracy came into play. The legal department made changes. Brand adherence contradicted legal. Design went over schedule. Way over schedule.</p><p>By the time the design was approved, I had a third of the time we\u2019d scheduled. And \u2014 since this was a Black Friday site \u2014 we couldn\u2019t push back the release date. It either launched on time or I was a failure. Period.</p><p>Not to be defeated, I powered through four straight days leading up to Black Friday, sleeping maybe six hours total. On Thanksgiving Day I skipped family get-togethers in favor of making the final push.</p><p>I was exhausted. Delirious. But, goddammit, I finished the project.</p><p>The client was thrilled. The site won a couple Addy Awards. I assume they made a metric fuckton in holiday sales.</p><p>Over the next few months, patches of my beard started to turn white. The whiskers became ultra-fine. Then they fell out altogether.</p><p>Shortly afterward, I lost my ability to grow a beard entirely \u2014 I was left with the unsavory choice between a clean-shaven \u201cgiant fat baby\u201d look and a creepy mustache.</p><p>I had stressed myself out so badly that my body had forgotten how to grow a beard. And for what? So I could work 19-hour days and skip family holidays to meet crazy deadlines?</p><p>I was exhausted. My body was failing. I was overwhelmed and unhappy and isolated. I had a mustache, for chrissakes.</p><p>I had been guzzling the Overkill Cult\u2019s Kool-Aid.</p><p>Something had to change.</p><h1>How to Tell If You\u2019re in a Cult</h1><p>The telltale signs we\u2019ve fallen prey to the Overkill Cult\u2019s influence are subtle:</p><ul><li>Frequently working more than 40 hours a week</li><li>Frequently sleeping less than 6 hours a night</li><li>Feeling guilty about any time away from work \u2014 even if that time is with family and friends</li></ul><p>We don\u2019t join overnight \u2014 this is death by a thousand cuts \u2014 and once we\u2019ve joined, we\u2019ll probably deny it.</p><p>But we\u2019ve joined. By the thousands, we\u2019ve joined.</p><h1>The Lies of the Overkill Cult</h1><p>The Overkill Cult\u2019s siren song seems like a healthy sense of ambition. \u201cWe have to work hard to get ahead.\u201d It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been told our entire lives.</p><p>We\u2019re doing what we think is best for the future.</p><p>But the Overkill Cult doesn\u2019t plan for survivors.</p><p>Though the symptoms of the Overkill Cult grow from good intentions, they\u2019re short-sighted habits that ultimately do more harm than good.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at each of the Overkill Cult\u2019s telltale signs, and how each of them is a long-term detriment disguised as a healthy work ethic.</p><h2>Frequently Working More than 40 Hours a Week</h2><p>Long hours often feel mandatory \u2014 it\u2019s just part of the culture. We think, \u201cMy boss/coworkers/cat will judge me if I\u2019m not working the same long hours as everyone else. I\u2019ll never get ahead if I don\u2019t go above and beyond.\u201d</p><p>This is just what it takes to make it, right?</p><p>Wrong. Incredibly, terribly, spectacularly wrong.</p><p>Research has proven over and over again that it\u2019s not possible to be productive for more than 40 hours a week. At least not for sustained periods of time. Henry Ford introduced the 40-hour work week in 1914 because he saw \u2014 through research \u2014 that workers on five eight-hour shifts kept up the highest sustained levels of productivity.</p><p>Despite over 100 years of research supporting shorter work weeks, many companies still push for long hours, under the claims of a \u201csprint\u201d or \u201ccrunch time\u201d period.</p><p>The irony comes in when we look at productivity over time. After just two months of 60-hour weeks, productivity goes negative compared to what a 40 hour week would have produced.</p><p>Did you catch that?</p><p>By working 150% of the hours, you accomplish less in the long run.</p><h2>Frequently Sleeping Less than 6 Hours a Night</h2><p>Somehow, sleeplessness has become a strange badge of honor. We swap \u201cwar stories\u201d of sleeping two hours a night with an odd, martyred pride shining dimly in our bloodshot eyes.</p><p>I never sleep because sleep is the cousin of death, we murmur drowsily. So many projects, so little time.</p><p>But this belief that burning the midnight oil somehow gets us ahead is utterly, tragically wrong.</p><p>You\u2019re the cognitive equivalent of a drunk driver after being awake for 18 hours. But the problem compounds: if you don\u2019t get enough sleep, that level of impairment comes faster the next day. After a few days of too little sleep, you\u2019re a drunken zombie.</p><p>We wouldn\u2019t go to work drunk, so why the hell do we go to work on four hours\u2019 sleep, when we\u2019re more impaired than if we were hammered?</p><p>To make matters worse, sleeping less than six hours a night may lead to an early death. The Overkill Cult is literally killing you.</p><h2>Feeling Guilty About Any Time Away from Work \u2014 Even Time with Family and Friends</h2><p>When we\u2019re in the clutches of the Overkill Cult, we feel a stab of guilt when we\u2019re not working.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go to this holiday party, but I really shouldn\u2019t; this project won\u2019t finish itself.\u201d</p><p>We fear that any time not spent working is wasted.</p><p>The irony is \u2014 yet again \u2014 science tells us exactly the opposite is true.</p><p>Overworking leads to higher stress levels and burnout, which have been linked to increased health risks.</p><p>Conversely, time away from work is proven to relieve stress and boost creativity, among numerous other benefits.</p><p>Besides, if we accept that the ideal is to sleep 8 hours a night and work 8 hours a day, that leaves us with 8 hours for non-work activities.</p><p>Taking time away from work gives us time to recharge. It puts distance between us and our projects, giving us time to remember why we like doing what we do.</p><h1>Making Our Escape</h1><p>We may have been duped into joining the Overkill Cult, but it\u2019s not too late to escape.</p><p>We\u2019ve been conned using our own best qualities to develop habits that \u2014 even though it seems like they\u2019d make us better \u2014 make us worse at our jobs, less satisfied with our work, and less happy in our day-to-day lives.</p><p>Leveraging the same strengths the Overkill Cult exploits, we can break free of its clutches and take back our happiness and passion.</p><p>After my beard died, I felt the full weight of burnout. I was burnt to a fucking crisp. I realized I could either leave my career altogether, or make some fundamental changes to my lifestyle.</p><p>For what it\u2019s worth, here are the promises I made to myself that helped me break away from the Overkill Cult.</p><h2>I Work as Much as I Can \u2014 But Not More</h2><p>Before anything else, I had to accept that it\u2019s only possible to do 6\u20138 hours of quality work each day.</p><p>Trying to work longer hours will not make me more productive. In fact, working longer hours actually results in me getting less done as time drags on.</p><p>I chose the latter, and implemented some radical (to me) strategies for controlling my time. I cut from an average of 70\u201390 hours a week in 2013 to an average 38 hours per week over the last year.</p><p>I expected to see less professional success in favor of better overall balance in my life \u2014 a sacrifice I was willing to make \u2014 instead I saw better productivity at work: my turn-around times went down and I was more consistently hitting my deadlines.</p><p>I was floored at the time, but in retrospect I\u2019m not surprised at all.</p><h2>I Make Sleep a Top Priority</h2><p>Getting enough sleep is beneficial on every level. Yet it was always the first thing I\u2019d sacrifice when life got busy.</p><p>Too little sleep wreaks havoc on my ability to think clearly, and that hurts me at work in a big, bad way.</p><p>After I cut my hours down, I started sleeping without an alarm. Since I\u2019m not working crazy hours, I close my computer by six or seven in the evening, and by eleven I\u2019m usually in bed, where I read for a bit before falling asleep. I wake up naturally between seven and eight-thirty.</p><p>This has changed my life. No bullshit.</p><p>Waking up to an alarm before I\u2019m fully rested starts the day in a groggy, stressful way. Waking up naturally after getting as much sleep as my body needs leaves me much happier to be awake, and far more ready to start my day.</p><h2>I Dedicate a Reasonable Amount of Time to NOT Working</h2><p>This was \u2014 and still is \u2014 the biggest challenge I faced in breaking away from the Overkill Cult. I love what I do, and I want to get my projects finished. It\u2019s easy to rationalize working more hours and skipping activities that keep me from working.</p><p>But now I know that taking breaks makes me more productive: time away from work lets my passion and excitement for the work renew itself; taking my mind off of a project allows my subconscious to roll around abstract ideas that result in better solutions; breaks from the job lower my stress levels and boost my creativity.</p><p>So I make sure to take time off, even if my gut (incorrectly) tells me it\u2019s a bad idea.</p><p>I take walks. I leave my phone in my pocket when I\u2019m out with friends or eating my meals. I spend a fair amount of time on my hobbies, like writing and hunting for the world\u2019s best cheeseburger.</p><p>I\u2019m happier today than I can ever remember being in my life. I feel excited to work on my projects, to pursue my hobbies, and to spend time with people I love.</p><p>I\u2019m excited to be alive.</p><h1>Leaving the Overkill Cult Saved My Life</h1><p>When my beard died in 2013, I feared it was only the first sign of an impending decline in my health that would ultimately kill me. It was a glimpse into my future, and I was terrified that if I didn\u2019t change, I was in for a life of isolation, ulcers, alopecia, and an eventual heart attack or stress-induced brain tumor.</p><p>By changing my lifestyle, I was able to turn things around. After just a year of balancing my work with the rest of my life, my beard grew back. I lost 30 pounds because I was actually going outside and making it to the gym. I felt more awake, and I became more positive.</p><p>When I left the Overkill Cult, everything in my life improved. Not one single thing got worse.</p><h1>Are You Ready to Make Your Escape?</h1><p>If you\u2019ve been sucked into the Overkill Cult, know that you\u2019re not alone.</p><p>You may be facing cultural pressure to keep this crazy pace. You may be struggling with your identity as \u201ca hard worker\u201d and feeling that scaling back somehow makes you lazy or useless.</p><p>But I promise you \u2014 despite the doubts the Overkill Cult will force into your mind \u2014 there\u2019s a better way. Better for your career. Better for your health. Better for your relationships. Better for your happiness.</p><p>You ended up in the Overkill Cult because you\u2019re smart, ambitious, and dedicated. But you were misled by your good qualities and turned them into bad habits.</p><p>There\u2019s a better way, and you\u2019re smart enough to pull it off.</p><p>Dump the Kool-Aid in the sink. Take back your freedom. Find the happiness and success you were looking for when you started this career.</p><p>Close your computer. Go outside. And call your friends; they miss you.</p><h1>What\u2019s Next?</h1><p>If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019d love to get away from the crazy hours and soul-sucking routines of the Overkill Cult, but you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s possible.</p><p>I was wrong. I just had to trust myself to take the first step.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to get some balance back? To have extra time every day to dedicate to the things that are most important to you?</p><p>I want to help: I\u2019ve compiled 5 Habits of the Unfuckwithably Productive, and I want to give it to you for free. These are time-tested habits that helped me escape the Overkill Cult; this is how I spend less than 40 hours a week on the computer \u2014 while making a living and traveling the world.</p><p>Click here to get the free guide.</p><p>Did this post make you smile, think, or nod in approval?

Each year, I make updates with new goals, progress pics, and lessons learned from the past year.***CLOSE NOTE***</p><p>INTRODUCTION : We are a full-time traveling family. Over a year ago, my wife and our 2 children sold everything and left our home in Provo, Utah for an adventure around the world. Before we left, and throughout our travels, health and fitness has always been a top priority for our family. Of course, eating clean and working out is difficult, especially when you travel full-time with kids! So here is our diet and workout plans that we travel with! Mine is different from my wife Jessica\u2019s, so we wrote them separate. His and Hers ;) Below is mine. Here is the link to hers : https://goo.gl/IVtuLR</p><p>[Jan 1, 2015] Here\u2019s the plan : I\u2019d love to get more fit. Like the absolute most fit my body is safely capable of. I don\u2019t know what that fully means but I\u2019m curious and motivated to find out. What does my body feel and look like at its very best?</p><p>[Jan 1, 2015] I currently work as a mobile app designer and spend a giant block of my days sitting behind a computer screen. Not ideal for a healthy body but I make special efforts to work it out. Ever since my early days in design school, it confused me why other designers (*stereotype alert*) seemed to care very little about the shape of their body. In my mind, our body is a \u201cblank canvas\u201d for us to shape and care for.</p><p>Perhaps the best project you will ever work on is you.</p><h1>Let\u2019s Start with the WHY..</h1><p>For me, there are generally 3 reasons for my health efforts:</p><p>\u2022 General health</p><p>\u2022 Athletic performance</p><p>\u2022 Body shape/aesthetics</p><p>Thanks to active hobbies and a progressively nutritious diet, my general health has been very good. As a collegiate soccer player, most of my workouts are based around performance. So really, for the first time ever, I\u2019m giving more focus to the 3rd point : Body shape and aesthetics.</p><p>Obviously, achieving a bigger/better body is only going to get harder as I get older. I\u2019m 25(ish;) now and feeling a \u201cnow or never\u201d self-induced pressure. The nice part is, the sooner I\u2019m able to achieve a higher level of fitness and health, the more of my life I\u2019ll be able to enjoy it.</p><p>So, here we go. 2015 is the year! This decision to change now will surely change my life forever! Some buddies are joining me and if you\u2019re feeling motivated, you can too. I\u2019ve done my best research and work to prepare..</p><h1>The Research</h1><p>I\u2019ve done crazy research in preparation for this. Side note : back in 2010 I actually got certified as a personal trainer through NASM. That gave me a good general foundation but that\u2019s about it. The body building industry is filled with debate. There are definitely numerous paths to similar end results. It seems every day there is a new trend, a new supplement, or a new \u201cground breaking\u201d discovery. I spent most of my time focusing on the basic principles that seem to be proven and agreed upon across the board.</p><p>3 Proven Principles:</p><p>- Diet : Diet makes all the difference. It can fully boost or fully block all your hard work and development. Here are lists for good supplements and also other good foods to shop for. Also, here is a rough idea of what I\u2019m eating on a daily basis : Meal Plan /// 4\u20135000 calories (based on my goal of clean healthy weight gain).</p><p>- Variation : No matter how high quality a workout is, if you never switch things up your body will eventually plateau. Variables like sets, weight, muscles, speed, intensity, lifts, and rest. Here is the list : The 7 Variables for Body Building</p><p>- Rest : This may be the most difficult part for me. Honestly, my body functions and feels good off little sleep. 4\u20135 hours and I feel good to go. I enjoy waking up early and having long busy days without a nap. But, I need to remember my goals and the importance of quality sleep. Here\u2019s the recipe : Muscle growth is stimulated when you workout. Muscle growth is fueled when you eat. Muscle growth happens, when you sleep!</p><h1>Here is My Plan</h1><p>No crazy shortcut supplements or fads. Just a consistent pattern of the right nutritious diet, hard work, enough sleep, and then even..more..hard..work.</p><p>I have constructed a specific MON-SAT workout plan that evolves every month. The variables and exercises change to stimulate progress and avoid plateauing. I have a dietary plan to properly fuel growth and recovery in the best ways using only natural and organic supplements.</p><p>Below is the template I designed for my monthly workout sheets.</p><p>I specifically designed my workout sheet so that each week\u2019s numbers would stack on top of each other. This makes it quick and easy for me to see what weight I lifted the week before, giving me a clear goal to beat. Having such a solid plan helps me be more efficient in the gym, pushes me to do more, and helps me appropriately space out days for rest between muscle groups.</p><p>Here is a link to view and download each month\u2019s workout sheet : https://goo.gl/oiH7Pw</p><h1>Progress Pics</h1><p>A lot of the resources I studied emphasized the importance and benefits of \u201cpublicly declaring your goals and plans.\u201d So..I guess I\u2019ve officially talked the talk :/ My resources also suggested posting my \u201cBEFORE\u201d pics. Not reeeally sure how I feel about some of these pics floating around the interwebs so we will take it slow and see how it goes. Unfortunately I definitely care about the opinions of others..so be nice! I will continue to add more as the year progresses..or until someone leaves a rude comment..</p><p>2015 : After 8 months of consistent hard work were rewarded with an adventure to Tahiti with my best friends/workout buds!! [video above]</p><h1>Fitness as a Full-Time Traveling Family</h1><p>[Jan 1, 2017] We started this fitness journey on Jan 1, 2015. At the time, I was playing soccer in school and working on my startup company. After selling my company and dropping out of school, we decided to sell everything and travel the world as a family. Although our lifestyle greatly changed, our dedication to fitness and health has remained constant. We prioritize every where we go to make sure we have a gym and healthy food available. Some places just don\u2019t have any sort of gym available but we still exercise first thing every morning using body weight and bands. We travel with 1 suitcase (of our 4 total) dedicated to a blender and supplements. We don\u2019t see it as exercise getting in the way of our travels. Rather, we find exercising in different countries a unique way to further experience cultures all around the world!</p><p>GOAL for 2017 : >180 lbs and <8% body fat.</p><h1>A work in progress</h1><p>This project is going to take me a good great long while. I\u2019m hoping the rest of my life ; ) I\u2018m definitely a rookie in many ways so please do send any advice, resources, encouragement or help my way.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Garrett</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Fitness", "Body", "Travel", "Inspiration"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*d2Qa10tPt_ya14V6izuRww.jpeg"], "url": "https://medium.com/personal-growth/myifguide-38037b3b1ec4", "dateCreated": "2016-07-19T19:18:46.685Z", "datePublished": "2016-07-19T19:18:46.685Z", "dateModified": "2021-05-31T22:19:47.573Z", "headline": "My Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle: How I Dropped 50 Pounds", "name": "My Intermittent Fasting Lifestyle: How I Dropped 50 Pounds", "description": "Hi there \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude04 My name is Sumaya and thanks to Intermittent Fasting (or IF for short), in 7.5 months I\u2019ve dropped 50 pounds, 10.5% in body fat and 40 inches around my body.

These results are entirely as a result of IF as I was unable to exercise for the first several months due to a fractured foot.</p><p>After college, I spent at least 5+ years in the overweight category (no thanks to bad habits, traveling and eating out) before spending another 5+ years in the obese category (no thanks to \u202astartup stress\u202c, late nights and even more work travel). I\u2019m now officially in the normal weight category (according to my BMI).</p><p>I tried everything from Jenny Craig/Weight Watchers to going to the gym 4\u20135x a week to weekly meal prep. While I did see some results, I eventually couldn\u2019t keep up with it and then yo-yo\u2019d. IF has been the simplest and most manageable way I have found to improve my health (and stick with it).</p><p>This post is intended for my friends (and friends of friends) who have been following my health journey on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or have asked how to get started. Because the interest has been in the thousands (so amazing!), I\u2019ve decided to share this information more publicly.</p><p>In the interest of time, I\u2019ve created this super quick start guide. In the near future, I\u2019ll be sharing more details, providing tips, and answering the most commonly asked questions I get.</p><p>The parts I\u2019ve highlighted in italics below are areas I plan to elaborate on in future posts. Again, this is meant to be a quick start guide. If you have specific questions, please do comment below or message me on Instagram or Facebook, or Snapchat.</p><p>If you find this guide useful, please tap the \u2764 button below!</p><h1>My Quick Start Guide to Intermittent Fasting</h1><h2>What is Intermittent Fasting?</h2><p>Fasting has been around for thousands of years and commonly practiced in major religions and utilized by medical practitioners.</p><p>There are many studies documenting the benefits of fasting which include lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes, reducing cholesterol levels, enhancing the body\u2019s resistance to oxidative stress (which is connected to aging and many chronic diseases), reducing inflammation (a key driver in many common diseases) and\u2026 weight loss! The weight loss benefit is how I first got introduced to Intermittent Fasting (or IF for short).</p><p>Like most other approaches to weight loss, the overall goal is to reduce calories without malnutrition. However, compared to the other approaches, Intermittent Fasting is focused on *when* to eat and when not to.</p><p>There are many different kinds of IF but for this quick start guide, I will be sharing the style I\u2019ve adopted and has worked for me.</p><h2>Before you start Intermittent Fasting</h2><p>I know many of you are itching to get started right away, but IF is not for everyone. It is not recommended for pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, people with diabetes, or other people who need to closely regulate their blood sugar. In addition, there has not been research on participants who are underweight, very old, or very young (<18 yrs. old) and these populations could be at higher risk for experiencing negative consequences of fasting (Longo and Mattson , 2014). So please:</p><ul><li>Visit your doctor and share your interest in IF. Make sure it\u2019s right for you.</li><li>Research more about IF and learn outside of what I share to see if there is a different style of IF that is a better fit for you and your needs. While there is widely available research on the benefits of IF, you should also learn more about the potential of negative effects of fasting on sleep, alertness, cognitive-motor performance, mood and for those with a previous history or susceptibility with eating disorders.</li><li>If you want to understand how full day fasts work (and the science behind it), check out the BBC documentary \u201cEat, Fast & Live Longer.\u201d It focuses on a style called Alternate Day Fasting. This documentary helped me in deciding to try IF as a lifestyle.</li><li>Check out my friend Daniel\u2019s journey in IF. I\u2019ve been grateful for his early support and guidance in adopting this life changing lifestyle. His journey in losing 60+ pounds was what initially got me interested in researching IF, and I found comfort in knowing someone who had success with it.</li></ul><h2>Measurements & Tools I Use</h2><ul><li>A scale. I use the Weight Gurus Digital Scale with smartphone tracking. This particular scale measures weight, body fat, muscle mass and more.</li><li>Weight loss tracking app. I love the Happy Scale mobile iOS app (it\u2019s free). It shows how your weight loss is trending, allows you to break your goals down into smaller milestone goals and can predict based on your current weight loss rate when you will hit your goals and more.</li></ul><p>The above two are the most helpful and what my friends and I use daily. The below are additional things I\u2019ve done to measure success (but not something you have to do or slow you down from starting IF). I love data, so I choose to do the following as well:</p><ul><li>Visual Progress. Take before photos! You may feel uncomfortable especially when you\u2019re first getting started, but you\u2019ll be thankful for them later.</li><li>Measurements. I also decided to take measurements using a flexible measuring tape when I first started and every four weeks or so. Sometimes the scale doesn\u2019t accurately show all of your progress and photos, and measurements tell a better story.</li><li>MyFitnessPal. I use this app to track my calories on Eat Days (but I don\u2019t use it religiously). I only do this to get a sense of how much I\u2019m eating and make sure I\u2019m eating more than enough on Eat days.</li><li>Detailed spreadsheet. In a spreadsheet I created for myself, I track all of the above and have used it to identify daily/weekly trends and help me figure out how to further experiment with IF. This has been a highly requested spreadsheet, and I hope to share the template in the very near future!</li></ul><h2>My Style of Intermittent Fasting: The 4:3</h2><p>I\u2019ve adopted what\u2019s called a 4:3 style of IF. This simply means, I eat 4 days during the week and fast 3 non-consecutive days of the week.</p><p>This is what my 4:3 weekly schedule looks like:</p><p>SUNDAY: Eat Day // I eat as I normally would throughout the day and I begin my fast at 9 pm PT (this means I stop eating or drinking anything with calories).</p><p>MONDAY: Fast Day // On fast days I only drink coffee, tea, non-caloric drinks and water (flavored sparkling water like La Croix has been awesome during fasting, my favorite is the Peach-Pear flavor). I add a little half & half in my coffee, and those are the only calories I consume on fast days. If/when I feel hunger pains on fast days, I drink a bottle/can of sparkling water and that helps me get through the day.</p><p>TUESDAY: Eat Day // I break my fast at 9 am PT. I eat my full day of meals. The total calories I eat is my TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) range. I use this tool to calculate my TDEE: https://tdeecalculator.net/index.php I start my fast again at 9 pm PT.</p><p>WEDNESDAY: Fast Day // Same as Monday.</p><p>THURSDAY: Eat Day // Same as Tuesday.</p><p>FRIDAY: Fast Day // Same as Monday & Wednesday.</p><p>SATURDAY: Eat Day // Same as Tuesday & Thursday.</p><p>SUNDAY: Eat Day // Same as Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday.</p><p>In summary: MWF = Fast Days, TuThSaSu = Eat Days. Repeat every week and you will see and feel the difference.</p><p>For the visual types, this is what my schedule looks like:</p><p>I start my fast at 9 PM and end the day after next at 9 AM, but these time frames can also be changed. Some of my friends prefer 7 PM/7 AM, 8 AM/8 PM, etc. to better accommodate their work/family schedule.</p><p>I have found that the 4:3 style fasts have worked well for my friends and me based on our work/life schedule and our personal health goals. I like that full day fasts feel like an on/off switch \u2014 I don\u2019t think about eating on fast days and on eat days if I happen to overeat, I don\u2019t feel guilty about it (since I\u2019m eating at a deficit during the week). I find it more manageable to cut calories over a week (using the 4:3 style of IF) instead of every day (trying to eating less daily).</p><h2>Tips for the first two weeks</h2><p>The first couple weeks can feel challenging since your body is trying to adjust but once you get through it, fasting will feel more like a habit.</p><p>Watch: 5 Tips to Make Your First Week With Intermittent Fasting Successful</p><p>Here are a few tips that helped me:</p><p>On Fast Days:</p><ul><li>Having water on hand (especially sparkling water like La Croix) helps a lot</li><li>Let people you see often (friends, family, colleagues) know you\u2019re experimenting with IF. You\u2019ll be surprised how many people will work around your schedule, be supportive and take interest in IF.</li><li>If you need help getting through a Fast day, you can have up to 500 calories to eat without it technically considered breaking your fast. The 500 calories can be used as a crutch to get through the first few fast days. After week 2, you shouldn\u2019t need it.</li><li>If for some reason you do break need to break your fast (and eat more than 500+ calories), count that day as an Eat day and eat your full day\u2019s worth of calories (your TDEE). Don\u2019t try to fast the following day and just stick with your weekly schedule.</li></ul><p>On Eat Days:</p><ul><li>I have found that eating high protein especially during my lunch and dinner meals keeps me better satiated on my fast days.</li><li>It\u2019s super important to EAT your full day\u2019s worth of calories since you are already eating at a deficit on your fast days. Do not skip meals or try to eat less.</li></ul><h2>Support Networks</h2><p>Intermittent Fasting can be challenging especially in the beginning which is why having support early on is important. I\u2019m fortunate that my sister, brother and good friends all fast with me now (which makes the lifestyle easier).</p><p>I encourage you to introducing IF to a friend, family member or even colleague so that you can experiment with it together! Additionally, there are great support groups on Facebook that I recommend. I\u2019m an admin and active in these groups:</p><p>WeFast Intermittent Fasting & Metabolic Performance Community This group includes doctors, specialists in the field, and people who fast for many different reasons including weight loss, biohacking, and living a longer life.</p><p>Intermittent Fasting For Women This is a fast-growing group that provides great support for women around the world who are exploring fasting.

I stopped at a red light in the Tenderloin and a worn, reedy man panhandling for change headed in my direction. He glanced me up and down as I tried to avoid making eye contact. I was about to say that I couldn\u2019t give him any money, which was true, both because my first professional writing job wasn\u2019t paying me enough to actually cover the rent on my apartment, and because I was so uncoordinated that I was genuinely afraid I would fall off of my bike if I tried to reach into my pocket for change. Before I could say any of that, though, he chuckled to himself and smiled at me. \u201cGood for you, big man,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep riding that bike.\u201d Then he walked away, having flipped my prepared pity on its head, and I wished I could have given him every dollar in my wallet to have not said anything at all.</p><p>That was back in 2008, when I weighed a mere 260 pounds. On January 1 of 2015, I lumbered onto a hotel scale which I was really hoping would be out of batteries in Austin and found that I weighed 334.7 pounds. I swore I would do something about it, and while that has been a quickly abandoned threat many times in the past, for some reason, this time it stuck. 364 days later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, I woke up and stepped onto a scale which delivered a much happier number: 206.0 pounds.</p><p>I lost just over 128 pounds this year, which is one of those things you\u2019re proud to do but not proud of having needed to do. In addition to trying to put some closure on a particularly dispiriting part of my past, I\u2019m writing this in the hopes of helping people who find themselves in a similar boat, who have approached the New Year with the sort of drastic self-improvement plans that I held this time last year. I\u2019m certainly not qualified to give professional advice on the topic, and I don\u2019t want to suggest that anybody of any shape or size should feel the need to change if they\u2019re happy with how they look. For those people who might want to radically change themselves in 2016, though, or those who are struggling with body image issues, I can tell my story of how I worked my way out of physical doldrums over the last 12 months. At the very least, I can write the piece I would have wanted to read at this time last year.</p><h2>Bad</h2><p>That starts with how I got to being 334.7 pounds in the first place. I was a fat kid growing up, eventually hitting 240 pounds by my junior year of high school. At 5-foot-11, I didn\u2019t wear that very well. Wanting something better for myself before I hit college, I lost 35 pounds over each of the next two summers, eventually making it to school in the fall of 2001 at 170 pounds, identifying as a quantitatively healthy adult. I spent the next three years fluctuating between 160 and 180 pounds. I was never truly satisfied with how I looked or felt, but it was easy to remember just how much worse it had been a few years earlier.</p><p>At the end of 2004, I was set upon by depression, the sort of overwhelming, crippling despair that is difficult to even fathom unless you\u2019ve actually experienced it. I would try to get out of bed in the morning and be so overcome with anxiety that my heart would palpitate. When I did go out, I would be inexplicably anxious to walk through the main paths of my campus and quickly get exhausted without any obvious cause. I took an internship and regularly fell asleep in the middle of meetings without warning. I would look forward to the weekend for respite from letting people down during the week and count down the minutes until the weekend to be over because I needed the routine of the weekdays.</p><p>Eventually, the mental and emotional symptoms I had been struggling with faded and became functionally manageable. I was blessed to be set up with an incredible psychologist at my school. Even today, her level of compassion and capacity for challenging and improving my self-awareness informs my own personal empathy and reduces me to awe. In the process of dealing with the depression, though, I developed a coping mechanism which would present an equally intractable problem in the years to come. Somewhere along the way, I became addicted to eating.</p><p>It took years for me to actually believe that I had a real problem. I associated addiction with alcohol and hard drugs, vices which thankfully (slash luckily) held little interest for me. The idea of being addicted to food is, at least in most cases, played for a joke; everybody has that friend with a ridiculously unfair metabolism who eats whatever they want and laughs about how they\u2019re addicted to food. This, obviously, is not remotely the same thing. During those fleeting moments when I would recognize the need to change, I would look over this list of questions at Overeaters Anonymous and identify with far too many of the criteria, only to put off the genuine self-evaluation and improvement for some indeterminate date in the future.</p><h2>Worse</h2><p>My compulsive eating had little to do with hunger and was almost never enjoyable. Instead, it was like trying to chase a vague, indefinable comfort, some satisfaction that never arrived \u2014 or even could arrive. It was the fear of missing out, but for food and constantly. I would struggle to pick between two fast food places and just stop at each of their drive-thrus, hiding the soda cup and the wrappers from the first one so the second cashier wouldn\u2019t see, because being caught in my embarrassing act was somehow more shameful than the actual behavior I was committing. The idea of just waiting for another day just wasn\u2019t realistic to me; I absolutely, compulsively had to get that sandwich from Wendy\u2019s. The act of ordering the food, of making the conscious choice to indulge, was far more important than eating the stupid thing.</p><p>Most of the time, though, it would be deliveries, always heaping amounts of unmemorable food. Most people in the mood for pizza would go grab a slice. I would go to the Domino\u2019s website and order a medium pizza. When I got fatter, that medium became a large, and then a large with wings. I still name my fantasy football team to this day after the local wing delivery place in Allston. I ordered from them so frequently that the delivery drivers knew me by name, and even worse, I knew them so well that I recognized how one of them wore the same Queens of the Stone Age hoodie every time he stopped by. (It was a pretty cool hoodie.)</p><p>I contorted my life and the stories I told myself to fit a horrific eating schedule. As a football writer, I sat in front of the television all day and night on Sunday. That meant a couple of food deliveries, justified in my head because I was too busy to cook or otherwise eat healthy. I would stay up overnight and file my Monday morning column for Grantland at 5 a.m., then get up at 9 a.m. to prep and record our podcast. Exhausted from the lack of sleep, my treat for working so hard the day before would be something unhealthy for lunch and then another delivery during the Monday night game. Throw in more awful food to eat during the Thursday night game (thanks for the extra day of games, NFL) and then going out with friends on the weekends or justifying a relaxing night in after a long week, and there was never a respite. I was constantly able to convince myself that it was OK to put off taking control of my life for another day.</p><p>Of course, the same weird bargains I made with myself in my head didn\u2019t extend to working out. Squeezing any possibility of progress out of my schedule was the most exercise I would typically get. I\u2019d take out a gym membership and go months without even thinking about attending. And then, when I\u2019d finally pay lip service to working out, I would find the easiest possible excuse to be lazy. It would be too cold to make the trek in the middle of a Boston winter and too nice outside to justify going in the spring. When I didn\u2019t have a car, it was too much of a hassle to take the subway, and when I did get one, it would be too much of a nuisance to park. I\u2019d sleep in and put off going in the afternoon, only to tell myself that it would be too crowded to go when the after-work crowd hit and too late to go in the evening. In part, it was laziness. Much of it, though, was that I was so far gone physically that I knew just how hard I would have to work to fix things, and how easy it was to just give up and pretend to try again tomorrow.</p><h2>Worst</h2><p>I recognized my behavior was idiotic and damaging, and there was some part of me which actually wanted to change, but I did nothing. That sentence makes no sense with any sense of perspective or reality, but it\u2019s a measure of how years of bad decisions had warped my brain. I\u2019d eat something unhealthy for lunch and then write the rest of the day off and eat something worse for dinner because I had already wasted the day. I would lie in bed, tell myself I was going to do better the next day, and then inexplicably do the same thing over and over again. I\u2019d go to the grocery store, buy the ingredients to make something reasonably healthy, and then go home and immediately order wings. It was Memento with fried food.</p><p>I would set some arbitrary point in the future and tell myself that I could eat whatever I wanted up to that date, only for it to never stick. I\u2019d write off the final two months of a football season and swear to start eating better in February, only to then tell myself that I should relax during my offseason and swear to eat better once football season got me in a routine. I\u2019d get healthy once I came back from vacation. Once I moved out of Boston. Then once I moved back to Boston. I\u2019d save my life once I turned 25. 27. 30.</p><p>And so, unchecked by reason, I grew. Morbid obesity costs you some semblance of your agency as a person, and while it\u2019s probably not the worst thing in the world for a white dude in his twenties to see some of his privilege disappear, I can\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t hurt. Friends who were happy to see me when I was thinner began to drift away. Bereft of confidence, it became increasingly difficult to meet new people, which made me less likely to go out, which reinforced how depressing it was to look terrible. I stopped caring about how I looked. After letting my facial hair grow for weeks out of sheer laziness before finally shaving, the very nice elderly doorman in my building in Vegas saw me and remarked, \u201cWow, Bill, you look so much younger without your beard!\u201d I glowed for a moment before he followed that up by saying, \u201cIt makes you look like you\u2019re still in your twenties!\u201d I was 27.</p><p>Outside of a few short sparks of self-assessment which never lasted more than a couple of weeks, I spent those twenties in a fog. I\u2019d fall asleep and wander into a dream where I was some younger, thinner version of myself, recognize how much better I felt, and then wake up to reality, like some sort of phantom appendage in reverse. The writer side of me consciously wished for some moment of clarity that sliced through everything and made it obvious that I needed to change, but that really wasn\u2019t the case. Not that it stopped me from trying to manufacture one. I\u2019d wake up the day after the Boston Marathon and decide that I was going to fix myself and somehow run a marathon one year later, despite the fact that I lacked the stamina to run around the block. I would take a meaningful life event \u2014 like the time a drunk driver totaled my car in Vegas \u2014 and try to use it as an anchor for change and a narrative into a new life. They served as neither.</p><h2>Better</h2><p>All that eventually became my normal. Instead of feeling like the real me was the one who had gotten in shape before college and given way to a temporary weight gain, it felt like the years when I\u2019d had control of my body image were an exception that I would never be able to re-create. I abandoned all hope that things would get better. I\u2019d managed to build a reasonable career and found a level of emotional stability, but I couldn\u2019t fathom that there would be a way for me to ever drastically improve how I looked. Instead, change came from a more familiar process and unexpectedly stuck: I got out of an unhealthy relationship and swore to work on myself out of the fear that I would otherwise have to settle for being unhappy. That happened a few times over the last decade, but this time, for whatever reason, this time, I didn\u2019t retreat back towards my old habits.</p><p>I pieced together one healthy, productive weekend in January. I made it to the gym on consecutive days for the first time in years, even if I could barely gasp my way through a couple of abbreviated workouts. I watched and wrote through a weekend of football while my brain shrilly reminded me over and over again that it was time to feed myself shit. I\u2019d open food delivery websites, read the menu, and close the window, or walk to the pantry to get snacks before shutting the door and walking away. I woke up Monday morning having strung together two consecutive healthy days and it felt, even for a moment, like I had found a possible way out.</p><p>Even with that modicum of success, I knowingly dismissed it as a hiccup, one that I would destroy with a bad decision within a matter of days. Thrillingly \u2014 surprising myself more than anybody else \u2014 I managed to keep it going. That weekend became a week. Then two. I hit a month and it was surreal, like I had somehow hopped into the ocean and caught a wave after ten years of getting smacked in the face by my surfboard. I was down 20 pounds and friends started noticing, which was enough to convince my brain that I couldn\u2019t go back on even that tiny bit of progress. And now, it\u2019s been a year and counting.</p><p>As I think about what I did to actually get in shape, the actual physical choices I made are a lot less important than they might seem. I knew that a healthy adult male ate about 2,000 calories per day, so I aimed for that figure, eventually settling into a range where I tried to eat between 1,800 and 2,400 calories each day. And I began going to the gym six days a week, almost exclusively using the elliptical machine, since I didn\u2019t think my joints could take much of a pounding after they had spent the last decade in energy saver mode.</p><p>Although I\u2019ve adapted and expanded my knowledge and obviously developed a more robust game plan, those two simple concepts are at the core of what I\u2019ve done all year. It was more important to show up every day and emulate that terrifyingly militaristic Tom Brady commercial than it was to worry about interval training and macronutrient ratios.</p><h2>And How</h2><p>Instead, other aspects of my rebuild were far more meaningful and seem wholly more important to reiterate here as advice. That starts with a point I wish I had figured out much earlier: you simply have to build a plan which works for you in lieu of copying somebody else\u2019s. You can read a million stories of how people lost weight and drastically improved their self-image, but unless you can apply the principles of what they did to something that actually fits you, it\u2019s almost always going to fail.</p><p>There was one piece in this vein I read quite a few times, especially when I was getting started earlier this year. HardballTalk writer Aaron Gleeman, somebody I\u2019ve been reading since I was in high school, wrote about losing 153 pounds over a one-year stretch between 2011 and 2012. (Go read it and come back. It\u2019s great.) When I was reading just about every Google hit for my \u201close [large number] of pounds in one year\u201d searches in January and February, it was easy to get discouraged. I\u2019d read articles that seemed to contradict one another while expressing levels of certainty about how their process was the one true platonic ideal of how to get fit now. The simplicity of Aaron\u2019s piece really resonated with me as a stat nerd: burn off more calories than you need to sustain your current weight and you\u2019ll start dropping pounds.</p><p>Aaron\u2019s story was easy to relate to, given that we are both sports bloggers with a healthy appreciation for Ma$e\u2019s career, but his path towards losing weight \u2014 specifically eating the same meal on a daily basis \u2014 never would have worked for me. I strongly suspected that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to diet in the way that Aaron had, so I pieced together an eating plan which vaguely resembled a far healthier version of the things I used to enjoy. Desserts were cut out altogether. Never a big drinker, I took beer out of the equation and didn\u2019t have any alcohol in 2015. I loved wings more than I loved most family members, but I had to cut them out of my life and replace them with grilled chicken. (The one exception was when I inexplicably walked past a buffalo wing restaurant in Tokyo and genuinely thought I was hallucinating.)</p><p>In the process, I actually began to re-program my brain into remembering how food could be enjoyable. Those wings in Tokyo were pure pleasure. I\u2019d stopped getting pizza delivered, but I would head out to Pino\u2019s for a slice and actually savor it in a way that simply didn\u2019t occur when I had been eating whatever I wanted. And then, instead of shutting down at the sign of something unhealthy and gorging myself with the idea that I needed to somehow get full before correcting things the next day, I planned the rest of my eating day around that slice of pizza and made my decisions accordingly. My relationship with food evolved into a philosophy which now rings through my head on a daily basis: Don\u2019t be a shithead.</p><p>I also found it incredibly valuable to log everything I did in a spreadsheet. In part, that\u2019s because I\u2019m a spreadsheet fetishist who would write longform pieces and love letters in Excel if I could. I\u2019m not sure any of this would have actually stuck if I hadn\u2019t started tracking what I was doing in a spreadsheet. I started really going out of my way to do so a couple of weeks into the process, and it\u2019s been both an invaluable resource and an incredible motivator. It\u2019s impossible to hide if you\u2019re actually counting calories every day, and there were so many times when I stopped myself from eating something because I knew how frustrated I would be if I had to type it into Excel. And likewise, the act of getting home and recording the calories I\u2019d burned at the gym became a weirdly satisfying conclusion to my workout.</p><p>After a couple of months, when I realized that this wasn\u2019t just some blip of self-preservation, I built a model to estimate my weight loss, dynamically calculating my basal metabolic rate (BMR) and using a Monte Carlo simulation to predict how many calories I would take in during a typical day. Few creations have ever been simultaneously as nerdy and genuinely sad. I weighed myself far more frequently at first, when I was desperate for positive reinforcement, than I do now. At this point, I have enough data to reliably trust the process. The Sixers are a good rebuilding thing to emulate, right?</p><p>Having reliable data also allowed me to set short-term goals along the way to my long-term ideal, another thing I had hugely underestimated in years past, when I would get discouraged by the scope of what I had to accomplish and give up before even trying. This weight loss timeframe estimator wasn\u2019t perfectly accurate, but it was a reasonable estimate and gave me hope of how quickly I could turn things around, especially at the beginning.</p><p>Some of my benchmarks were downright embarrassing. I don\u2019t know that anybody should be as happy as I was about only weighing 300 pounds, but that was the first round number I hit. I was in Hong Kong and hopped on a scale which weighed me in kilograms and excitedly typed it into Google three or four times to make sure I hadn\u2019t messed up the conversion. Or there was the moment a couple of weeks ago when I went into a store in Brooklyn and tried on a medium-sized sweater. Having worn a medium at my thinnest before eventually expanding all the way to XXXL shirts by the beginning of 2015, it really meant something when the sweater fit and didn\u2019t look horrific. I started uncontrollably laughing out loud in the changing room (in part to avoid crying), which must have been incredibly confusing and a little terrifying to the tiny female employee on the other side of the door who didn\u2019t know why this lunatic was giggling as he tried on a shirt.</p><p>More than anything, though, the lesson I learned from all of this was how incredibly important is it to forgive yourself. Once I got stuck in that downward spiral of eating poorly and not taking care of myself, it was so incredibly easy to beat myself up and dismiss all hope. It\u2019s harder to escape, too, because during those brief moments where I felt motivated to actually try and change things, I\u2019d feel like I needed to be perfect from then on to get out of my predicament as quickly as possible while I still had the, um, momentum. (This is awkward.) When I would inevitably screw up, it would feel like I\u2019d failed a mission and had to start from the very beginning, and that would always lead to giving up altogether. At 25, I\u2019d look back and wish I had done all this when I was 22, and then repeat the same cycle at 28.</p><p>It seems simple to say now, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way! Now, I\u2019m just happy I didn\u2019t wait until I was 40. It\u2019s easy to preach about sunk costs in football, but it\u2019s harder to actually recognize them in my own life. There have been days where I screwed up and ate like a shithead again. I\u2019ve missed workouts. It happens. I\u2019ve woken up the next day and gotten back on the wave. Even right now, I\u2019m frustrated with myself because one of my biggest long-term goals was to get under 200 pounds by the end of 2015. I came up six pounds short. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll hit it sometime this month and be just as happy. Instead of being angry at myself for throwing away years of my life, I believe in myself and my ability to enact change in a way that I could not have fathomed this time last year.</p><h2>And Next</h2><p>Even then, I\u2019ll be far from finished. I\u2019d like to settle somewhere between 160 and 170 pounds, and that will take a few more months. I\u2019d like to transition from simply trying to get thinner to really focusing on trying to be healthier, which will be a more difficult process. There\u2019s the thorny issue of separating self-image and self-confidence from a number, an issue on which I\u2019m making progress, but one that\u2019s always going to be easier as I get happier with the number.</p><p>Compared to a year ago, though, I\u2019m in a much better place. I\u2019m typing this in the middle seat on a cross-country flight, which would have been hours of hell for me and my seatmates years ago. My sides and hips are not spilling against and underneath the armrests. The seatbelt \u2014 one seatbelt \u2014 fits me with room to spare. I\u2019ll take the subway home from the airport and be able to sit down without being self-conscious, because I won\u2019t be afraid that I\u2019m going to take up two seats. Happiness in those sorts of public situations is the ability to be anonymous. I don\u2019t feel any compulsion to eat something awful in the airport to tide me over during my flight or go home and order shit because I had a long day of traveling.</p><p>And honestly, I know that things are never going to be perfect, which is fine. My body\u2019s never going to look good. Right now, it looks roughly like a chubby old man was cryogenically frozen for a decade and then thrown in the microwave to thaw out. Even if I get to the number I want, it\u2019s going to be a life-long fight to actually keep that weight off and stay healthy. That\u2019s how addiction works. I haven\u2019t conquered or solved anything.</p><p>What I have managed to do is wipe away a lot of what went wrong over the last decade in the course of a year. More importantly, I feel like I\u2019ve found a series of principles that I trust to keep me from falling into those same traps again. After years of being unable to get over my past, it\u2019s impossibly fulfilling to feel like I actually have control over my future.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Weight Loss", "Self Improvement"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*9BHzgELRESLEsIWDhzajsg.png"], "url": "https://medium.com/@justjudyanne/2016-is-not-killing-people-984b583a0ecc", "dateCreated": "2016-12-26T15:08:39.037Z", "datePublished": "2016-12-26T15:08:39.037Z", "dateModified": "2020-08-21T00:01:12.017Z", "headline": "2016 Is Not Killing People - Judy Anne - Medium", "name": "2016 Is Not Killing People - Judy Anne - Medium", "description": "Many people have a superstition that 2016 has been an unlucky year causing beloved artists to die to soon.

It is drug and alcohol abuse.</p><p>People exclaimed over and over as one well known artist after another died too soon, \u201c2016 is the worst! Please stop now!\u201d But one important thing quietly slipped by this year with barely a notice that is related to many of the deaths we have experienced this year. A study was released by the CDC stating that the US Life Expectancy has decreased for the first time since 1993. And no one knows why. There are a few thoughts to the cause such as obesity, opioid abuse and suicide. The important thing to pay attention to is, if you are in you 40\u2019s or 50\u2019s, you will probably not live as long as your parents or grandparents did and it may be due to a life threatening addiction.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at the two most recent health events suffered by famous people, George Michael and Carrie Fisher. George Michael died of heart failure at 53 and Carrie Fisher suffered a massive heart attack at 60. According to those close to him, George Michael, an enthusiastic user of cannabis for decades, moved on to dabble with a deadly selection of new narcotics in the past few years (some will remember his 2008 arrest for smoking crack cocaine). The singer, who dropped out of public view after releasing an album last spring, was said to be smoking crack cocaine again recently. \u2018He spends all day in a dark room with a pipe,\u2019 a friend said \u2018It\u2019s his addictive personality \u2014 everyone is scared to death about him.\u2019 Carrie Fisher is so well known for her drug & alcohol abuse she is often referred to as \u201cnoted former cocaine user Carrie Fisher\u201d in articles about others who have done the drug.</p><a>@carriefisher</a><a>thesun.co.uk</a><p>Here is the thing, cocaine is the perfect heart attack drug, even if you only use it a few times a year. Cocaine users have higher blood pressure, stiffer arteries and thicker heart muscle walls \u2014 all which lead to heart attacks. 2016 did not cause mysterious illnesses to befall our favorite artists. A disease from which I suffer and is as deadly as any cancer is killing my generation at an alarming rate at no one wants to admit it.</p><p>Prince was larger than life, but died from a very human disease that is surrounded by stigma and almost impossible to get treatment for.

There and then, I decided I have had enough. Enough of wallowing in self-pity, enough of not staying committed to my fitness goals, enough of being disappointed in myself, and decided to be the change I wanted for myself. This is just the beginning of a life long journey and I am already excited for the next leg of it. #workit PS: yea, that\u2019s a captain America shirt and when civil war comes out, I will probably be on his team \ud83d\ude1d</p><p>I shared my progress on Facebook last night, and some friends wanted to find out what I had done to lose weight. This post is just my experience over the last 60 days.</p><p>So here is my 7-step weight loss plan!</p><h2>1. Determine your body type</h2><p>Being a mesomorph is one of the main reasons I am able to lose weight easily. The reverse is also true, I can gain up to 2kg in a week if I remain inactive. To maintain my weight, I need 20mins of moderate workout at least 4\u20135 times a week.</p><h2>2. Determine your body fat percentage, basal metabolic rate, calorie intake</h2><p>It is important to monitor your body fat percentage, and not just focus on how much weight you are losing. Weight loss can result from many reasons, water loss, muscle degradation, and you want to be sure that you are gaining muscles and losing body fats.</p><p>Calculate your body fat percentage here: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/becker11.htm</p><p>The amount of energy (in the form of calories) that the body needs to function while resting for 24 hours is known as the basal metabolic rate, or BMR. This number of calories reflects how much energy your body requires to support vital body functions if, hypothetically, you were resting in bed for an entire day. In fact, your BMR is the single largest component (upwards of 60 percent) of your total energy burned each day.While you can\u2019t magically change your BMR right away, knowing your personal number, how it\u2019s calculated, and which factors most influence your metabolism, can help you use this data point to create a smarter strategy for weight loss (or maintenance).</p><p>Check your basal metabolic rate here: http://dailyburn.com/life/health/how-to-calculate-bmr/</p><p>Calorie mindfulness: In order to lose weight, you need to have slightly less calories going in than you need, so your body will tap into the reserve energy stored in your body. Be sure, you don\u2019t starve yourself. This will result in your body going to \u201cstarvation mode\u201d and it will do everything to hold on to the fats in your body because it thinks you will not be able to get nutrients on time. Losing weight is possible when you eat right. This will come in handy when you move on to the stage of determining your diet.</p><p>Check your optimal calorie intake for weight loss: http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html</p><h2>3. Set your goals</h2><p>You need to set goals for yourself. This can be intimidating. I had a total weight loss goal of 21kg, and wanted to loose 6\" off my hips (I started at 41\" when I came back from my holiday). This can seem very difficult and almost impossible to achieve.</p><p>I broke down my goals into mini goals, so that I would feel motivated every time I reached one of my mini goals. This kept me going especially during periods when I would hit my plateau.</p><p>Personally, my plateau points were 72kg and 69kg. The next plateau point I will reach is at 65kg. This means that for 1\u20132 weeks, I will not see any change in my weight. Don\u2019t freak out if this happens. Sometimes your weight might even go up. If you have been eating healthy, and consistently working out, this just means that your body is putting on muscle and soon you will notice the fats melting away. Everytime I break my plateau points, I lose another 1\u20131.5kg in 1 week.</p><p>Mental preparation for weight loss regime is critical for maintaining this as a lifestyle rather than just a phase that you go through to get a \u201csummer body.\u201d You need to believe that you can shed the weight and this should be supported by why are you doing this. Is it to just look good for a holiday or are you making a commitment for life? This way, you won\u2019t be yo-yoing between your weight, which itself is bad for your body.</p><h2>4. 80/20 rule of losing weight</h2><p>Hang on! We are halfway through the plan and we aren\u2019t even at the workout plan? There is a simple explanation for this, that you have to remember.</p><p>Losing weight is a strategic game plan. You need to have a plan in mind before you start hitting the gym aimlessly. Sure, you will lose some weight, but will you be able to keep it off? 80% of your body is shaped in the kitchen, and only 20% of is dependent on your workout itself.</p><p>So what does this mean? It simply means that you have to be mindful of your diet. Knowing more about your food, how it is being prepared, and the nutritional values of what you are putting into your mouth will help you change the way you eat.</p><p>I used to eat everything because I am such a food lover. I still eat what I love but in moderation. Previously, I used to have chocolates on a daily basis, and now I only have it once a week maximum.</p><h2>5. Your body is maketh in the kitchen</h2><p>I spent a lot of time researching on diets that will help me optimise my weight loss. I had done something similar in 2014, when I was even more of a health nut so I had a head start this time.</p><p>Start with small, gradual changes to your habits. This will help you commit to the new changes. Diving headfirst into a complete overhaul can be a shock to your system and you are more likely to switch back to your old habits. I enjoyed going onto pinterest and discovering new healthy recipes to try out.</p><p>My food plan breakdown:</p><ul><li>Breakfast: I start by drinking either lemon water or Ginger honey tea to kickstart my digestive system. I like to add chia seeds to my drinks so I get an extra boost of fiber & nutrients as well. Breakfast is either Oats with some berries or a protein rich breakfast of 2-ingredients banana pancake. I have now taken to spreading a little coconut butter on my pancake, just to switch up the flavors some days and it is packed with healthy fats!</li><li>Lunch: For the first two weeks, I didn\u2019t have any meat at all. I was mainly vegetarian and I would have seafood anytime I craved meat. This is something I do to cleanse my palate. It helps me to adjust better to the healthier options I am switching to in the upcoming weeks because their flavors are more light and usually meat, especially red meat, masks their flavor. Since then, my lunch consists of a serving of salad with some protein component. If I am cooking from home, I have salmon fillets in my fridge which I fire up over a pan and have it with some veges. If I am buying from outside, I look for grilled options and eat with no-carbs. Or at the most, as a wrap.</li><li>Snacks:This makes a huge difference! I swapped out all my sugar treats that I normally reserve for this time, with nuts or berries and the change was incredible. Without all this refined sugar running through my blood, my mind is more alert, my skin got clearer, and there weren\u2019t any epic dips in my mood during the evening from the dreaded sugar crash.</li><li>Dinner:I kept my dinner light. Usually it was some steamed fish with boiled or grilled vegetable medley.</li><li>Other tips:</li><li>Drink water! I cannot emphasise the importance of staying hydrated. It shocks me how little people drink water. I usually have about 1.5L of water by lunch, and another 1L by dinner, and then about 2\u20133 cups of water before I sleep. My friends call me a camel. haha!</li><li>Instead of eating fried food, switch to grilled or steamed food</li><li>Start eating more alkaline food instead of acidic food</li></ul><p>The benefits of the alkaline diet are said to include higher energy levels, fat loss, increased concentration and clearer skin.</p><ul><li>Reduce or stop processed food. If it has too many chemicals, then you know it\u2019s bad for you.</li><li>Stop intake of alcohol or limit yourself to just one glass.</li><li>Reduce dairy intake or just stop it altogether</li></ul><h2>6. Workout routines</h2><p>I love to work out. I love how I feel when I am doing weights and I can feel myself getting stronger.Every time I am able to lift a heavier weight, or increase my reps from the last time I did it, I would get an euphoric high that is kind of addictive.</p><p>Biggest myth that women must overcome: Using weights will make you into a ripped out hulk!</p><p>Girls, go pick the weights, the barbells, the kettle bells! You will not pack on muscles like a ripped body builder. We don\u2019t have enough testosterone to develop overly bulging muscles. You can lose fats faster when you have more muscles because they are the ones burning the fats in your body.</p><p>\u201cYou need to exercise at full intensity because the end goal is to burn more calories, and high intensity exercise does just that,\u201d says Natalie Jill, a San Diego, Calif.-based certified personal trainer. High intensity workouts mean you\u2019re going all out for as long as you can. If this sounds intimidating, think of it this way: You\u2019ll burn more calories in less time.</p><p>I usually go to pinterest to give me inspiration. I have saved all the workouts that I do here on Pinterest. When I started going back to the gym in November, I started with just 20mins in the gym. Sticking to going to the gym 3 times a week, working out with HIIT trainings helped to rev up my stamina and got me back into the headspace I needed to commit to the change.</p><p>\u201cYou need to do a combination of weights and cardiovascular training,\u201d says Sangeeta Kashyap, MD, an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic. Strength training increases muscle mass, which sets your body up to burn more fat. \u201cMuscle burns more calories than fat, and therefore you naturally burn more calories throughout the day by having more muscle,\u201d says Kate Patton, a registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic. Patton recommends 250 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 125 minutes of high-intensity exercise a week.</p><p>On days that I don\u2019t have time to commute to my gym, I will work out from home. I have saved a list of workout videos that you can mix and match to create your own personal workout playlist.</p><p>You just have to commit to coming back 2\u20133 times a week,and soon you will find yourself doing more. If you are a beginner to working out, it would be better to join classes with a trainer or have a 1-on-1 trainer.</p><p>Form is everything in exercising. If you do it wrong, you are more prone to injury and your workout wouldn\u2019t be efficient anyway. I have worked with personal trainers who have guided me in getting my form right so I am able to work out without much guidance.</p><p>When it comes to workouts, you should do activities that you love. Because this will make you happy to do it, and you will look forward to the activity so you will keep going back. Think about it, aren\u2019t you more likely to do something that you love rather than something that you hate? Our subconscious mind is built to drive us towards pleasure. So try out different activities and do what gives you most happiness.</p><p>My weekly routine:</p><ul><li>Sunday: Interval running for 10mins. (slow warm up for 3mins, then 40s sprints for 4 rounds 20s normal pace, 200m all out sprint, 2mins cool down)</li><li>Monday: Arms, back, shoulders</li><li>Tuesday: Legs & core</li><li>Wednesday: Cardio & strength training from home</li><li>Thursday: Arms, chest & shoulders</li><li>Friday: Legs, thighs, & core</li><li>Saturday: Break [the break day sometimes swaps around depending on my commitments for the day but I stick to working out 6 days a week]</li><li>Warm-ups: I do 8mins on the staircase climber machine, then 10mins on the row machine, and then either strength or cardio on the rope-pull machine.</li><li>Cool down: Stretches to loosen up the muscles, and it varies depending on the muscles being worked out that day.</li><li>Music: I love listening to music with fast beats, inspirational lyrics while I work out because it helps me to keep my pace.</li></ul><p>I plan to incorporate more HIIT trainings moving forward because they are amazing fat blasters!</p><h2>7. Give yourself a break</h2><p>This is a lifelong commitment. It\u2019s not a fad. So give yourself a break. When you are out, and you see a cake that you really really want to have, buy it. Share it. Or eat it by yourself. Research has shown that if you constantly deny yourself, you are bound to binge when you finally get what you want. So just savour the moment. There is no such thing as a \u201cguilty pleasure.\u201d Just \u201cpleasure.\u201d And you deserve it!</p>", "tags": ["Weight Loss", "Fitness", "Health"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*go797_uKIjKrwcSe.jpg"], "url": "https://betterhumans.pub/the-sweet-spot-for-intermittent-fasting-9aae12a2158c", "dateCreated": "2016-08-12T11:01:01.921Z", "datePublished": "2016-08-12T11:01:01.921Z", "dateModified": "2019-05-24T01:07:06.547Z", "headline": "The Sweet Spot for Intermittent Fasting - Better Humans", "name": "The Sweet Spot for Intermittent Fasting - Better Humans", "description": "Intermittent fasting \u2014 the practice of going without food for some (undefined) period of time \u2014 has many health benefits.

D. Mangan</a><a>Aug 12, 2016\u00b75 min read</a><h1>Lower insulin means greater fat loss</h1><p>Intermittent fasting \u2014 the practice of going without food for some (undefined) period of time \u2014 has many health benefits. It can help prevent heart disease, speed fat loss, and slow or reverse aging.</p><p>There are a number of physiological mechanisms involved. It reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, leads to increased numbers and quality of mitochondria, and increases autophagy, the cellular self-cleansing process.</p><p>Many of the beneficial effects are entwined with lower levels of insulin.</p><p>The function of insulin is to promote energy storage and the growth of the organism. When insulin is increased, fat is stored in fat cells, and other cells take up glucose from the blood.</p><p>Most importantly, when insulin is increased, lipids can\u2019t leave fat cells. Since fat loss is all about getting lipids out of fat cells to be burned, losing fat requires some attention to how diet, exercise, and fasting cause insulin to rise or fall.</p><p>Take a look at the following graph, taken from a paper by Volek et al. It shows that even small increases in insulin, within the normal range, virtually abolish lipolysis (the breakdown of fat).</p><p>This is where intermittent fasting comes in, as one of its effects is to lower insulin levels and thus increase lipolysis. The question is: how long do you need to fast before insulin comes down?</p><p>Eating causes insulin to rise. The amount of the rise is dependent on a number of factors, such as type and amount of food eaten and the insulin sensitivity of the person doing the eating.</p><p>High amounts of carbohydrates and lower insulin sensitivity cause a greater rise in insulin.</p><p>Insulin increases and stays higher for several hours after eating \u2014 that is, during the \u201cfed\u201d state. The absence of food during fasting lowers insulin.</p><p>What duration of fasting lowers insulin and to what extent?</p><h1>The Sweet Spot for Intermittent Fasting</h1><p>Ted Naiman, M.D., whose great site is Burn Fat Not Sugar, posted the following graph recently (used with permission). The information comes from a paper, \u201cProgressive alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism during short-term fasting in young adult men\u201d.(1)</p><p>Dr. Naiman suggested that \u201cthe sweet spot for intermittent fasting\u201d occurs between 18 and 24 hours of fasting since this is the time period that sees the greatest drop in insulin and increase in lipolysis \u2014 the breakdown of fat.</p><p>Eyeballing the graph and comparing it to the one above from Volek shows that at an insulin level of about 40 pmol/L, lipolysis should be proceeding briskly.</p><p>There has been lots of guesswork as to how long intermittent fasts should last. One very obvious but usually non-verbalized reason is that most people don\u2019t want to fast for very long, and after a certain time most people get hungry. But they do want to lose fat.</p><p>A very common duration of intermittent fasting, one that I often do, is about 16 hours. A 16-hour fast involves skipping only one meal, typically breakfast, so it\u2019s easy enough. A shorter fast than this wouldn\u2019t involve missing even one meal, so we probably couldn\u2019t characterize it as a real intermittent fast.</p><p>But according to the information above, in terms of insulin level, the fast is only really getting going at 16 hours. Extending it further than this ramps the drop in insulin and the increase in lipolysis.</p><p>If you can extend your fast into the afternoon, you get more benefits, and a 24-hour fast would do even more.</p><p>One thing I would add to Dr. Naiman\u2019s \u201csweet spot\u201d is that duration matters for insulin level. In other words, it\u2019s not just a matter of achieving a low insulin level, but how long you stay there. Therefore, longer fasts can be of great benefit \u2014 though inconvenient in terms of hunger and normal life.</p><h2>Fasting promotes autophagy</h2><p>One of the great benefits of intermittent fasting that I\u2019ve written about often is that it promotes autophagy, the cellular self-cleaning process that breaks down and recycles damaged molecules and cellular organelles.</p><p>During the fed state, when insulin is increased, the rate of autophagy is low. During the fasted state, as insulin drops, autophagy increases dramatically, perhaps 5-fold.</p><p>Many of the anti-aging effects of calorie restriction and intermittent fasting come from the increase in autophagy.</p><p>A high rate of autophagy is characteristic of young organisms; with aging, autophagy decreases, and this allows cellular damage to accumulate. By fasting intermittently, autophagy rates can be reset to that of a younger person.</p><p>As we see above, one of the ways this happens is through lowering insulin.</p><p>Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, so for any given fasting stimulus, a person who is in shape will see insulin levels drop and lipolysis commence faster than someone not in shape.</p><p>Low-carbohydrate diets cause less of a rise in insulin, so probably someone on a low-carb diet who then fasts will also see a quicker drop of insulin into the range at which it promotes lipolysis and autophagy.</p><p>Autophagy is suppressed in the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. (2) This may be one of the main mechanisms behind the deleterious effects of diabetes and obesity.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that the study cited by Dr. Naiman used healthy young men as subjects, and they presumably had good insulin sensitivity.</p><h2>Fasting as an anti-aging intervention</h2><p>As noted, by increasing autophagy, intermittent fasting causes the breakdown and clearance of damaged cell parts.</p><p>Aging just is the accumulation of damage. As we age, we can no longer recycle damage as readily; cell constituent turnover decreases.</p><p>We saw in the interview with Dr. Michael Fossel that activating telomerase has the effect of increasing cell turnover to youthful levels by lengthening telomeres.</p><p>Dr. Fossel roundly rejected my suggestion that, until telomerase therapy comes along and/or it\u2019s shown to truly reverse aging, intermittent fasting is the best way to slow aging.</p><p>But, he\u2019s wrong. If the accumulation of damage characterizes aging, and if the aging organism is characterized as being less able to clear damage, then increasing the rate of clearance is the best way to slow aging.</p><p>One of the best ways to increase clearance of damage, and hence to slow aging, is through intermittent fasting.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Weight Loss", "Fasting", "Intermittent Fasting", "Anti Aging"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*Q3CR8FyI56MQIAnU."], "url": "https://ketoschool.com/the-science-behind-fat-metabolism-60f7a3f678d0", "dateCreated": "2016-01-02T15:50:36.841Z", "datePublished": "2016-01-02T15:50:36.841Z", "dateModified": "2020-07-25T16:28:34.764Z", "headline": "The Science Behind Fat Metabolism - KetoSchool", "name": "The Science Behind Fat Metabolism - KetoSchool", "description": "Per the usual disclaimer, always consult with your doctor before experimenting with your diet (seriously, go see a doctor, get data from blood tests, etc.).

Assuming your metabolism is functioning normally, if the switch is on you will store fat. If the switch is off, you will burn fat.</p><p>Therefore, all things being equal, \u201cdiets\u201d are just ways of hacking your body into a sufficiently low-glycemic state to trigger the release of a variety of hormones that, in turn, result in a net loss of fat from long-term storage.</p><p>That pretty much sums it up.</p><p>If you want to lose weight from fat cells, those cells need to store fewer calories than they release. What most people do not understand, however, is that this is not as simple as \u201ccalories consumed\u201d vs. \u201ccalories burned\u201d; your body responds very differently to 200 calories from a cookie, for example, verses 200 calories from broccoli.</p><p>Furthermore, as long as protein-intake is reasonably high enough, your body will not burn a significant amount of muscle protein (i.e. you won\u2019t lose muscle mass, but you will lose body fat).</p><p>If you\u2019re curious to read more about the details, I spend a fair amount of time below introducing the science of how carbs, fats, proteins, fibers, alcohol, caffeine, vitamins, minerals, water, gut microbiota, lipoproteins, cholesterol, sleep, exercise, mental health, etc\u2026 contribute to overall fat metabolism.</p><h1>What is Fat?</h1><p>\u201cFat\u201d, depending on the context, can mean different things (e.g. specific molecules, cells, tissue/food, and/or a physical body state). On a cellular level, there are a bunch of different types of fat cells and fat tissue. What most people are referring to when they are talking about the biology of \u201cfat\u201d is white fat cells, especially those located just under the skin (i.e. subcutaneous fat).</p><p>Below is a simple illustration from wikipedia that gives us a decent idea of the tissue and cells we\u2019re talking about:</p><p>Those large white blobs (termed \u201clipid droplets\u201d) in the white fat cells are what house our triglycerides (TAGs\u2026get used to this acronym, I\u2019m going to use it a lot). The lipid droplets are what grow and shrink as TAGs come and go. Chemically speaking, TAGs come in different varieties, but are always made up of a glycerol molecule plus three fat molecules, resulting in a structure that looks essentially like this:</p><p>The alpha (\u03b1) \u201cfirst\u201d, omega (\u03c9) \u201clast\u201d, and numbers on the bottom part there are labels (from a chemist\u2019s perspective) for specific carbon atoms. On the other hand, biologists, to make our lives easier (I\u2019m joking), count from the other direction. You may have heard of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, which means the third carbon from the right has a double bond. Indeed, the keen observer will see that the bottom molecule in the figure above is an Omega-3. And yes, FYI, a \u201cfatty acid\u201d are those long squiggly things. So when you say the word \u201cfat\u201d to a biochemist, these are the molecules that come to mind.</p><p>As a final point of technical background here, let\u2019s clarify \u201csaturated\u201d versus \u201cunsaturated\u201d fat. This terminology has to do with the \u201csaturation\u201d of hydrogen atoms around the carbon atoms. Simply put, unsaturated fat has double bonds between one or more of of its carbon atoms (i.e. the double line things) and saturated fat are those that don\u2019t.</p><p>You\u2019ve probably heard scary and opinionated things about saturated vs. unsaturated fat, and by all means, do what your doctor tells you. But for some peace of mind, know that your body needs both to function properly.</p><h1>How do fat cells grow?</h1><p>So, given the background above, the specific question we\u2019re curious about is what causes TAGs to accumulate in lipid droplets within white fat cells?</p><p>As you can imagine, the current answer (subject to change) is quite complex. I\u2019m going to start the answer by categorizing the types of substances we consume into general buckets (there are, of course, more\u2026 but this provides sufficient coverage for our discussion here and helps us think carefully about what we eat and drink).</p><ol><li>Carbs \u2014 At the end of the day, starches and sugars we eat (from bread, pasta, corn, potatoes, desserts, etc\u2026) are broken down in your digestive system into monosaccharides. The two main monosaccharides we\u2019ll consider in this article are glucose and fructose, since they are overwhelmingly the most common (and therefore the most important regarding fat metabolism).</li><li>Fiber \u2014 The various forms of carbohydrates we eat that aren\u2019t digested are commonly called fiber. Fibers come in water soluble and insoluble forms and facilitate digestion of everything else we consume.</li><li>Fat \u2014 These are the oily molecules that contain saturated and/or unsaturated carbon chains as mentioned above. They come in the form of TAGs, various other combinations of fat molecules, and as \u201cfree fatty acids\u201d from a gazillion different kinds of oils and animal fats. (As a side note, Trans fats, which are common in processed foods, are a type of unsaturated fat that is altered to a form that is not usually found in nature. Here is more specific information about why the FDA is concerned about them)</li><li>Protein \u2014 There are 22 standard building blocks (\u201camino acids\u201d) that make up all proteins in the human body. Nine of these are not able to be produced by our bodies, so we need to ingest them (hence, they are termed \u201cEssential Amino Acids\u201d).</li><li>Caffeine \u2014 This merits a bucket of its own since we consume so much of it. There\u2019s a reason why the classic \u201cdiet pill\u201d has large amounts of caffeine in it.</li><li>Alcohol \u2014 This also merits its own bucket, since we love to drink. Alcohol is a known \u201ctoxin\u201d and has important, though debatable, effects on fat metabolism.</li><li>Vitamins & Minerals \u2014 Many vitamins and minerals are important in direct (and indirect) ways for our discussion. As we\u2019ll talk more about below, it\u2019s a good idea to take supplements, under the guidance of your doctor, if you restrict common foods (e.g. dairy, gluten, etc\u2026) from your diet.</li><li>Water \u2014 Last but not least, if you drink too little or too much water it can throw your whole system off, as every chemical reaction in our bodies involves water in one way or another.</li></ol><p>Now, given these general buckets, let\u2019s talk about how each one relates to TAGs filling up our fat cells.</p><h1>Glucose Metabolism</h1><p>First and foremost, out of all the buckets, it\u2019s important to note that glucose is by far the major player here. While on a normal \u201cwell-balanced\u201d diet, the concentration of glucose over time in your blood is the key upstream factor to consider in the metabolism (both build-up and break-down) of fat.</p><p>When your blood has high concentration of glucose for a sufficient period of time, your pancreas kicks insulin into gear, which tells your cells to take in glucose, put it in a temp storage (like RAM in your computer) called glycogen, and put everything else into long-term storage inside your fat cells.</p><p>On the other hand, when your blood has a low concentration of glucose for a sufficient period of time, this process is reversed. Your pancreas releases a protein called glucagon, glycogen is depleted, a bunch of other hormones (epinephrine, cortisol, testosterone, etc..) are introduced into your system, and TAGs are thereby pulled from your fat cells and converted into Acetyl Co-A, which is the key precursor for the process your body uses to generate \u201cenergy\u201d (i.e. ATP) for your cells.</p><p>So, as it relates to our digestion here, a key process to consider is the adsorption of glucose into (and across) your intestinal wall. It\u2019s a relatively short story. This is why when you eat/drink sugary stuff it goes quickly into your blood. These blue and green transporters (yes, it\u2019s active transport, not passive, which means it takes energy) are efficient at getting the job done:</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that the rate of getting free glucose into your bloodstream is quite high when you have, surprise surprise, free glucose in your lumen (intestinal tube). Once glucose gets into your blood, then insulin does its job. Here\u2019s a simple graphic that describes the basic process:</p><p>But before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let\u2019s talk a bit about what form glucose takes as we consume food and drink. Most of our glucose is packaged in starches (breads, pasta, corn, potatoes, and such), but we also get a fair amount via common table sugar, too (i.e. sucrose). This chart shows the basic breakdown pathways of starch, sucrose, and lactose into glucose:</p><p>As an important side note, High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS, which is in everything these days) is our food industry\u2019s way to mimic table sugar (sucrose) for a lower price. Most HFCS in soft drinks is 55% fructose and 42% glucose, and HFCS in pretty much everything else is 42% fructose and 53% glucose. The rest of the percentage, for those doing the math, is maltose or maltotriose \u2014 that is, 2 or 3 glucose molecules bound together, respectively.</p><p>From a biochemistry standpoint, know that HFCS is essentially just fructose and glucose mixed together. It takes a bit more \u201cwork\u201d for our body to breakdown table sugar (i.e. via sucrase, as noted above), which means glucose from HFCS goes into our blood \u201cfaster\u201d, depending on what you eat with it. Again, this consideration (i.e. the speed in which glucose gets into our blood and its concentration there) is the most important thing to talk about when it comes to regulating fat storage in our body.</p><h1>Fructose Metabolism</h1><p>Ok, so we know that glucose gets into our blood quickly and is used by all cells, stored temporarily in glycogen, and stored long-term in fat cells. But what about fructose?</p><p>Structurally, here is the exact difference between glucose and fructose:</p><p>As you can see, both have six carbons, but the fructose carbon ring is smaller (the other carbon is hanging off as an additional CH2OH group). But why does this matter? Well, for one, fructose tastes sweeter to us (which is nice, I suppose). Second, fructose is absorbed into our blood via a slightly different route than glucose, and is relatively slower to do so unless ratios of glucose to fructose are similar. Third, once in your blood, fructose can only be processed by your liver, where \u2014 when introduced in reasonably low concentrations \u2014 it is converted to glucose and mainly stored in glycogen:</p><p>However, in higher concentrations, and especially when there is plenty of glucose around, fructose can do unhelpful things, including a more direct route to storing TAGs in our fat cells and a propensity toward non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD):</p><p>Fructose does not stimulate insulin like glucose does, so in small amounts fructose participates relatively harmlessly with our normal energy storage and supply. But, indeed, part of the reason why soft drinks with HFCS are so \u201cbad for us\u201d is because it\u2019s easy for us to drink too much, which thereby sends a significant percentage of it into our fat cells (especially around the liver).</p><h1>Fiber</h1><p>Now that we know the basics of TAG production and storage from glucose and fructose, we can better understand why limiting the rate of adsorption of these molecules into our blood is important. This is \u2014 in part \u2014 where fiber comes in, and is a component of why the recent craze around eating \u201cwhole foods\u201d is significant. Unprocessed foods generally contain more fiber (as well as more vitamins and minerals, which are often leached out during processing).</p><p>The below chart nicely sums up a ton of information about why fiber is important for overall fat metabolism.</p><p>It has been well documented that increased fiber in the diet reduces the concentration of glucose in the blood. The mechanisms behind this are not completely known, however, but it is likely because of a binding effect that prevents the degradation of carbs into free glucose.</p><h1>Fat</h1><p>If you\u2019ve ever gone on a low-carb diet while still eating a decent amount (if not more) fat, you\u2019ve probably been surprised that you actually lost weight. What\u2019s up with that? Doesn\u2019t eating fat make you fat?</p><p>Well, to answer this, let\u2019s go ahead and follow the same process we did above with glucose and fructose.</p><p>First, when you ingest fat, your digestive system breaks it down to its component parts, i.e. free fatty acids and monoglycerides. And, as you can guess, the rate of this degradation depends on what else you are eating (e.g. fiber). Once the molecules are freed up, they are adsorbed via a completely different mechanism than glucose and fructose. Here is a great summary:</p><p>Getting more specific on that last step there, here is how fatty acids are ultimately turned into energy:</p><h1>Lipoproteins and Cholesterol</h1><p>In addition to the mechanisms it takes to get energy out of fat molecules, it\u2019s important to note (albeit somewhat tangentially) what else our body does with fat. Here is the basic structure of a Lipoprotein, which our cells produce to move fat, cholesterol, and other lipids around the body (T = TAGs, C = Cholesterol):</p><p>You may have heard of \u201cHDL\u201d and \u201cLDL\u201d when visiting the doctor and reviewing your blood work. There are actually five different types of lipoproteins that vary in size and density (H = \u201cHigh\u201d, I = \u2018Intermediate\u2019, L = \u201cLow\u201d, VL = \u201cVery Low\u201d, D = \u201cDensity\u201d, L = \u201cLipoprotein\u201d) :</p><p>From large to small,</p><ul><li>Chylomicrons carry TAGs and cholesterol from the intestines to the liver, muscles, and fat cells.</li><li>VLDLs carry new TAGs (with cholesterol) from the liver to mainly fat cells.</li><li>IDLs are general transporters that are essentially VLDLs with the TAGs removed.</li><li>LDLs are also general transporters that carry mainly cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, TAGs, and phospholipids out from the liver to cells around the body.</li><li>HDLs mainly carry TAGs and cholesterol back to the liver.</li></ul><p>Cholesterol, FYI, is critical for our health since it\u2019s a key ingredient in our cell membranes, and it\u2019s the key precursor for vitamin D, bile salts, and a bunch of critical hormones. Our bodies produce all the cholesterol it needs (from, yes, our friend Acetyl Co-A), and \u2014 contrary to popular opinion \u2014 consumed cholesterol doesn\u2019t really effect our lipoprotein profiles or risk for heart disease.</p><p>The reason why our discussion of lipoproteins is important for fat metabolism is because HDLs are needed to properly respond to the call to get energy out of our fat cells. It\u2019s also better for us to simply be informed about how this all works, to be less afraid of ingesting fat.</p><h1>Protein</h1><p>Can protein make you fat? The short answer is yes, but not efficiently. When you eat protein, it gets broken down into \u201cpeptides\u201d (i.e. chains of amino acids) and absorbed into the blood via mechanisms like this:</p><p>Free amino acids in the blood can then be used for energy, including getting converted into pyruvate and acetyl Co-A:</p><p>And as you can see, this is mainly for the purpose of getting energy out of our proteins, but it is possible that in excess, the Acetyl-CoA can get converted into fat (per the mechanisms described above).</p><p>At the end of the day, however, amino acids are \u201cbest\u201d used for actually building and maintaining proteins in our body (including those in muscle tissue).</p><h1>Caffeine</h1><p>As we consume caffeine, an energy spike kicks in and \u2014 as we consume even more \u2014 most people get jittery and less coordinated. The basic mechanism here is to block your nervous system from getting drowsy and to increase hormones such as epinephrine (a.k.a. adrenaline). Caffeine itself is not the energy, despite what marketing from \u201cenergy drink\u201d companies will tell you.</p><p>As it relates to fat metabolism, caffeine has been shown to promote TAG release from fat cells. While it\u2019s not clear exactly how this happens, it\u2019s thought to be a combination of the properties of caffeine itself along with the effects of epinephrine (i.e. calling for energy release).</p><p>Thus, diet pills are often packed with caffeine and, for some people, actually help the weight loss process. For others, the negative effects of caffeine (e.g. lack of good sleep) actually counteract the process and lead to a net weight gain.</p><p>So, in short, be careful with caffeine. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Again, always consult with your doctor on these issues if you have questions and/or are considering changing your diet.</p><h1>Alcohol</h1><p>When you consume alcohol, you are consuming \u201ccalories\u201d, but the relationship to fat gain/loss is highly debatable.</p><p>Looking at the basic science, alcohol can indeed be turned into Acetyl-CoA via:</p><p>\u2026which in turn, similar to what we described downstream from fructose and protein above, can lead to fat production and storage (especially around the liver) with sufficient biochemical \u201cpressure\u201d (e.g. when blood glucose levels are high).</p><p>Another proposed effect of alcohol on weight control is blocking the oxidation of lipids (i.e. the process of getting energy from fat). One such study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that alcohol can lead to weight gain if the body already has enough energy in place, saying:</p><p>the ingestion of ethanol as additional energy above nutritional requirements is a risk factor for obesity, because it decreases lipid oxidation and therefore favors lipid storage.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps more obviously, when you drink your judgement is impaired. Thus, you\u2019re less inclined to actually \u201clisten to your brain\u201d that\u2019s telling you to stop eating.</p><h1>Vitamins and Minerals</h1><p>Vitamins (A, Bs, C, D, E, K) and minerals (calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, etc\u2026) are key components and regulators of many of the processes described above. Notable examples are B1, B2, and B5, which are all involved in the various stages of deriving energy from fat, proteins, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, Iron, Niacin, and B6 help metabolise L-carnitine, which is essential for the transport of fatty acid components to energy-producing areas of cells.</p><p>The list of similar examples is extensive, but what is key for our discussion here is that if you are deficient in any vitamin and/or mineral, it can mess up all your other efforts. For example, being low in Vitamin D or Calcium can affect your ability to stop eating, and being low in magnesium can seriously mess with your insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Therefore, it\u2019s a good idea to have your blood checked on a regular basis to see if you have any vitamin or mineral problems. Getting to a healthy baseline here is, obviously, an important component to overall health.</p><h1>Hunger and Satiety (i.e. Feeling Full)</h1><p>In the areas of appetite control, yet again we run into a \u201chighly complex\u201d set of overlapping systems. The basic elements are:</p><ul><li>Physical volume \u2014 your stomach has stretch sensors that tell your brain when to eat and when you\u2019ve had enough. This is, in part, why eating low-density, high-volume foods (like leafy greens) are important for satiety.</li><li>Fat/Carb/Protein ratios \u2014 everyone is slightly different, and it depends on what you\u2019ve been eating the past couple of days, but in general your digestive system wants to receive a decent balance of these basic macronutrients.</li><li>Vitamin & mineral diversity \u2014 we\u2019ll often crave particular foods if we\u2019re lacking vitamins and/or minerals (e.g. craving chocolate when low in magnesium, craving red meat when low in iron, etc\u2026)</li><li>Mental health \u2014 depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders often have a significant impact on hunger and satiety (one way or another).</li><li>Sleep \u2014 not getting enough can be problematic (we\u2019ll talk a bit more about this in the next section).</li><li>Dehydration \u2014 not drinking enough is also cause for concern, and drinking more water (as our intuition always suspects) helps significantly with satiety.</li></ul><p>Underneath these factors are four important hormones that regulate appetite:</p><h1>Sleep</h1><p>Sleep is extremely important regarding obesity in children and in adults. This topic merits an entire series of articles (and books!) on its own, so I\u2019ll refer you first to Matthew Walker\u2019s book Why We Sleep and his podcasts/AMAs with Peter Attia.</p><p>Long-story short, a lack of length, diversity, and \u201cquality\u201d of the various stages of sleep will have dramatic effects on a large number of biological systems, hormone levels, and cognitive functions related to energy metabolism. Focusing on improving all aspects of your sleep is essential to healthy fat loss.</p><h1>Gut Microbiota</h1><p>Another area of fat metabolism research that is gaining popularity concerns the population of bacteria inside our intestines. Early research shows that its relationship to dietary fiber, the absorption of carbohydrates and fat, and effects on appetite are more significant than previously thought.</p><p>One of the concerns of taking strong antibiotics, for example, is that it can throw off your gut microbiota and possibly lead to weight gain. On the flip side, some strains of probiotics may actually lead to weight gain as well.</p><p>Thus, how your gut microbiota adjusts to your diet over time, and how food, drink, and medications may affect this composition will be, as many suspect, a significant area of research in the near future.</p><h1>So\u2026.should I still count calories?</h1><p>If you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019ve hopefully realized that not all \u201ccalories\u201d have the same effect on fat metabolism, and that counting calories can be an overly simplistic way to think about it. Here is a decent summary graphic of the basic pathways for proteins, carbs, and fat:</p><p>In other words, your body will get energy one way or another, but one of the best ways to effectively burn energy from fat-cell TAGs is to keep your carb consumption low. By a long shot (as anyone who has ever gone on a low-carb diets knows), our body strongly prefers to use the green route above for energy. If you tweak your diet to make your body use mostly the yellow route for energy, it \u2014 by definition \u2014 facilitates overall fat burning.</p><h1>What about exercise?</h1><p>Everyone should exercise daily, mixing up high-intensity and low-intensity cardio, stability/flexibility training, and lifting weights. There really isn\u2019t any debate on this. Exercise burns energy stored in glycogen and fat, which helps your body regulate blood-sugar levels and overall energy metabolism.</p><p>However, unless you are an extreme athlete \u2014 or go through periods of extreme exercise \u2014 contrary to popular opinion, cardiovascular exercise rarely has a significant impact on the overall quantity of TAGs in your fat cells. While indeed you expend energy and burn through glycogen and fat when you workout for long enough \u2014 your body adjusts for this via increased hunger and consumption of carbs, fats, proteins, etc\u2026</p><p>As you may have heard, building muscle does, indeed, raise your basal metabolic rate (so it\u2019s a good idea to lift weights!). But again, your body adjusts to this new rate by compelling you to eat more. In fact, in order to gain muscle you need to be in energy-positive situation and let insulin do its work of bringing in energy and amino acids in for \u201cmuscle building.\u201d</p><p>So, with regard to fat metabolism, this is a short section of the article. Everyone should exercise daily for overall muscular, cardiovascular, and mental health.</p><h1>How do we shrink fat cells, then?</h1><p>In order for our bodies to start pulling TAGs out of lipid droplets, the appropriate signals need to be sent to receptors on the surface of fat cells. When glucose resources are low, this activates a wide variety of hormones to help get the job done, including (to varying degrees and roles) epinephrine, norepinephrine, corticotropin (ATCH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol, ghrelin, testosterone, human growth hormone (HGH), adiponectin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon, and leptin. Here is a sample of the receptors that have been discovered on fat cells:</p><p>Not all are involved in telling adipocytes to release TAGs, however (though many, indeed, are, giving you an idea of the complexity here).</p><p>Below is the basic process by which leptin, as an example, stimulates the brain to signal the release of \u201cfight or flight\u201d (sympathetic) hormones that kick fat burning into gear.</p><p>And it\u2019s not just catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) that are involved, many of the hormones mentioned above also activate PKA (Protein Kinase A) in fat cells and work with ATGL, HSL, and MGL to break down TAGs and kick out fatty acids (FA) and glycerol.</p><p>So, as you can see, to lose weight all you need to do is keep glucose levels down, make sure that these hormones are triggered effectively, and don\u2019t eat more calories than you burn, right?</p><h1>Easier said than done</h1><p>Everyone has a different \u201cmetabolism\u201d (i.e. the rates and efficiencies of the metabolic pathways and biochemistry described above), and these factors always change as we get older. In other words, genetic and environmental factors will make it virtually impossible for some people to have a low body mass index (and vice versa), and most Americans are destined for an increasing BMI until the age of 60 or so.</p><p>This chart is especially disturbing since the Center for Disease Control indicates that a BMI of 25 or above is \u201coverweight.\u201d Uh oh. If you have a relatively large amount of muscle mass it will throw your BMI calculations off, but it\u2019s an important metric for the overall population.</p><p>Now, there is the other end of the spectrum, as all of us suspect in the back of our heads. There are risks to low BMIs. One study found that \u201cadults who are underweight \u2014 with a BMI under 18.5 or less \u2014 have a 1.8 times higher risk of dying than those with a \u201cnormal\u201d BMI of 18.5 to 24.9.\u201d But, to put that in perspective, if you are 5\u20195\u201d you\u2019d have to weigh less than 111 pounds, and if you are 6\u20190\u201d you\u2019d have to weigh less than 137 pounds.</p><h1>Ummmm\u2026so how can I lose fat?</h1><p>To actually get into a \u201cfat-burning\u201d state, the simplest explanation is to keep your blood-sugar level low for as long as possible and ensure nothing is getting in the way of your metabolism (e.g. vitamin/mineral imbalances, stress, lack of sleep, etc\u2026). Obviously, people lose weight on diets all the time; and at the end of the day \u2014 biochemically speaking \u2014 this is how it always happens.</p><p>Whether you pick a low-fat or a low-carb diet, it\u2019s mostly a mental game. Maybe eating a small amount of carbs 4\u20135 times a day (along with a bit of fat and protein) makes you feel better and you can actually keep your overall glucose and insulin levels low. Or, maybe you prefer to essentially cut the carbs and keep eating reasonable amounts of fat and protein. You need to experiment yourself \u2014 and consult with your doctor \u2014 to figure out what works for your unique metabolism.</p><p>But, that being said, knowing \u201cthe science\u201d behind all this can help us think through a few things:</p><ul><li>Glucose in the blood spikes insulin, and if your glycogen stores are full and your cells aren\u2019t directly needing energy, glucose will get converted to acetyl Co-A, built into TAGs, and shoved into your fat cells.</li><li>On the flip side, a low level of glucose is what triggers glucagon to get energy from glycogen, and it\u2019s what triggers hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, ghrelin, testosterone, human growth hormone, etc\u2026 to pull TAGs out of fat cells for energy and to compel your body to eat.</li><li>A great way to keep your glucose levels in check is to eat food/drink combinations that slowly move glucose into your blood. This is where \u201cwhole foods\u201d and fibers come into play, which also help with vitamins and mineral diversity. There are various \u201cindexes\u201d (e.g. glycemic index, insulin index, satiety index, etc\u2026) that can help you identify food/drink to try experimenting with yourself, but these indexes are not an exact science because various combinations of foods you eat together can change things up.</li><li>The key game to play is with appetite and mental sanity. When your glucose levels are low, your body hates you until you adjust to a ketoic state. For low-carb diets, hours 48 through 96 (ish) are the worst as you transition, and then you start feeling better. The long term effects of staying in diet-induced ketosis are debatable, though practically speaking our culture (in America, at least) does not facilitate low carb diets, so few people make it longer than 7\u20139 months anyway (and, BTW, that time frame is generally safe). Those that do go that long, however, usually enjoy about a 20\u201340+ lbs weight loss, but rapidly gain it back because controlling weight with more carbs in a diet is really, really hard.</li><li>Alcohol combined with a bunch of carbs will help you gain weight, but if you keep glucose levels low, your body will use it for energy and avoid converting it into TAGs for long-term storage.</li><li>Caffeine, in moderation, can help boost your epinephrine levels to promote fat burning. Too much can throw you off, however, and cause you to consume more glucose to balance things out.</li><li>Do what your doctor tells you (and find a doctor who isn\u2019t afraid of salt and healthy fats).</li><li>Get regular physicals and specific blood work done that checks for mineral/vitamin imbalances.</li><li>Understand that exercise is important for muscular, cardiovascular, and mental health (and sleep), and you should do it daily, but it\u2019s effect on fat loss is minimal unless you change your diet.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, the best game to play here is how to hack the mental process of staying reasonably \u201chealthy\u201d (however you and your doctor define that) while not freaking out about having a few TAGs in your fat cells. Knowing all the science above should help each of us, in concert with our health care providers, put together a customized plan for long-term health.</p><p>Author\u2019s note: I\u2019d love to hear from anyone with suggestions on how to improve this article.

A week before doing this experiment I tried buying myself more time by sleeping just six hours per night.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t sustainable. In fact, I was so groggy and sleep deprived it had the unintended result of lower overall productivity.</p><p>So, naturally I was skeptical when I heard you could sleep just three hours per night with no adverse effects.</p><p>But I had nothing to lose. In fact, IF THIS WORKED, I could gain the extra time I\u2019ve been seeking for years. So I HAD to try it out.</p><p>Here are my experiences and lessons from the most incredible sleep experiment I\u2019ve ever tried.</p><h1>A Quick Lesson on Sleep</h1><p>If you\u2019ve ever used a sleep tracker you\u2019ll notice sleep is split into two categories \u2014 light sleep and deep sleep.</p><p>During light sleep you are settling in, moving fairly frequently, muscles relaxing, body cooling, and lightly dreaming. This represents 60% of sleep.</p><p>Deep sleep contains two phases \u2014 deep and Rapid Eye Movement (REM).</p><p>During deep sleep you are hardly moving, you aren\u2019t dreaming, and your body is repairing cells, consolidating memories, and building up muscle tissue.</p><p>During REM sleep your brain is active again and you are dreaming intensely. The science isn\u2019t clear on what exactly REM sleep does, but it\u2019s suggested that it plays an important role in memory storage and mood balancing. Things you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with.</p><p>Combined, deep and REM account for 40% of sleep.</p><h1>Polyphasic Sleep \u2014 The Everyman Method</h1><p>So how does one sleep only three hours at night and still get enough deep sleep?</p><p>Polyphasic Sleep (as opposed to Monophasic sleep, or sleeping once a day) is the idea of breaking your sleep into smaller chunks, or naps, to maximize your waking hours.</p><p>The hope is to drop light sleep and achieve deep sleep each time you close your eyes.</p><p>Polyphasic Sleep has many forms.</p><p>The most extreme one is the Uberman method. It consists of six 20-minute naps for two total hours of sleep a day.</p><p>A less extreme form and the one I\u2019ve chosen for myself is dubbed the Everyman method. It consists of one \u201ccore\u201d sleep lasting between 3\u20134 hours, and three 20-minute naps throughout the day for a total of four to five hours.</p><p>I have chosen the Everyman method as it provides more flexibility. Also, to be honest the idea of never sleeping for more than 20 minutes intimidates me. Perhaps that\u2019ll be my next experiment.</p><p>So what are the benefits? Why should you deprive yourself of a glorious eight hours of sleep?</p><h1>Uninterrupted Time</h1><p>Think of the last time you had a five hour block of fully-focused, uninterrupted time. Can you imagine the possibilities if you had that every day?</p><p>No one else is waking up at 3am. Which means no one is emailing, Slacking, or texting at 3am.</p><p>I use my daily uninterrupted time to (finally) take coding seriously, start this blog, do more research, and enhance my writing abilities.</p><p>I discovered that doing everyday things like reading the news, watching Youtube, or playing games are not worth sleeping less over.</p><p>Thus, many temptations to let my mind wander are naturally eliminated, making these morning hours ultra-productive.</p><h1>Better Sleep</h1><p>Not more, but better.</p><p>My first few days were rough. I don\u2019t often nap during the day, and it was difficult for me to learn to unwind.</p><p>But this issue didn\u2019t persist for long because missing a single nap feels like missing a whole night of sleep. Enough missed and poor naps and I was shocked into a proper schedule.</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how great I feel if I get a good core and three solid naps. I sleep from 10pm-2am, 540am-6am, 1140am-12pm, and 440pm-5pm. You can move those times to fit your work and social life.</p><p>I no longer get post-lunch, food-induced comas. Sleeping right before lunch eliminates this issue. Trading 20 minutes before lunch for 2 hours of lost productivity after lunch is a killer deal.</p><p>Although I get really tired four times a day (it sets in about 30 minutes before core and 5 minutes before naps), I am attentive and sharp for many more hours than before.</p><p>Topping up four times a day rather than one has a way of keeping you fresh.</p><h1>More Time to Do What You Want</h1><p>I have many interests. I enjoy reading, staying current on events in politics and tech, designing and building things, watching Netflix and VidAngel, executing on ideas, writing, outdoor recreation, listening to music, learning new skills, videography, and photography, to name but a few.</p><p>But as much as I enjoy these hobbies, I refuse to compromise family time or work performance for them.</p><p>Now I spend more time with family, get more work done, and explore more of my interests.</p><h1>Some Tips</h1><ol><li>Don\u2019t drive if you are tired! This may seem obvious, but when you are tired on the Everyman schedule, you are really tired. My wife has teased me for how I can be delirious right before bedtime.</li><li>Don\u2019t drink caffeine. It\u2019ll throw everything off, and you won\u2019t be able to calm your mind as easily. No sense in introducing another obstacle.</li><li>Put your headphones in and listen to ambient sound. It can be difficult to unwind enough to nap in the middle of the day \u2014 especially when it\u2019s bright outside. Ambient sound can help you block out noise and focus internally. I use the Noisli app. Rain and fire at 100%, leaves at 20%.</li><li>Make sure you are passionate about something. It can be challenging to wake up after only three hours of sleep. If you don\u2019t have something you are yearning to do, you won\u2019t have the motivation to wake up. I switch things up regularly to make sure I stay motivated. A few things on my list include study how to write better, actually write, learn HTML/CSS/Javascript, read out loud in Japanese (helps with retention and pronunciation), build out my portfolio, create movies, and read books. Need an idea starter? Here\u2019s a handy list Buzzfeed put together on things to learn and do.</li><li>Find a schedule that works for you. I work from home so I have the luxury of dictating my hours. My friend who introduced me to Polyphasic sleep doesn\u2019t. He takes one nap right before work and one right after. But he still needs to take one at work. He made it clear to his boss that this was an important thing to him. His boss accommodated and lets my friend take his pre-lunch nap in a break room. This request really shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Plenty of people take bathroom breaks longer than 20 minutes.</li><li>Listen to your body. You\u2019ll feel extra tired over the first week, but if you are sick or otherwise afflicted, return to a normal sleep pattern. There aren\u2019t any long-term studies on the benefits and detriments of Polyphasic sleep. Therefore, proceed at your own risk. Everyone experiences discomfort for the first week as they acclimate. Don\u2019t give up too early, but don\u2019t push it too far.</li></ol><h1>Bottom Line</h1><p>I like to experiment. I love discovering new tools and methodologies for improving my life. This blog is going to be about the lessons I learn through my research and experimentation.</p><p>I constantly seek to disrupt my habits and patterns in hopes of elevating or shifting my paradigms. It\u2019s the best way to take personal growth into my own hands.</p><p>Polyphasic sleep is one of those game changers.</p><p>In this case, the big WHAT IF was so appealing that I started the night I heard about it. Sure the initial sleep depravation was rough, but the productivity gains were immediate.</p><p>Regardless of how long I continue the Everyman method of sleep, I know I am better off for having done it.</p><p>If you decide to try Polyphasic sleep in any of its forms, please, let me know. And if you have lessons of your own, please share those too!</p><p>Enjoy your extra time :)</p><h1>Read my followup articles:</h1><h2>8 observations from 30 days of sleeping just 3.25 hours per night.</h2><h2>Have We Been Wrong About Sleep This Whole Time?</h2><p>Edit Jan 2018 \u2014 Updated article and title to 3 hours per night.

Just six days later, I received the following message from a friend:</p><p>I just wanted to drop you a line and thank you for that post\u2026 My lab results at the beginning of the month were 230. After just this last week it\u2019s down to 155. I think I\u2019ll be in normal range within a month. Really miraculous\u2026 It\u2019s really been a game changer for me already and I wanted you to know how much I appreciated the info and how much of a difference I think it will make in my life.</p><p>Four months later, the friend posted this to Facebook:</p><p>I started on this regiment when Nathan posted about it [four months ago]. My blood glucose level at that time, while taking two daily glucose meds, was 235. Two weeks ago, my [fasting] glucose level, WITHOUT the meds, was 68.</p><p>If you google \u201cdiabetes cure\u201d you are directed to websites like WebMD and the Mayo Clinic where you find information on diet, exercise, medication, and insulin therapy, but nothing about the cure. This lack of information may have to do with the fact that Americans spend $322 billion a year to treat diabetes, $60 billion a year on weight-loss programs, and $124 billion a year on snack foods. This is about 3% of the US economy! Because so many peoples\u2019 livelihoods are supported by diabetes and its main cause, obesity, the viral effect of people getting cured and telling others is greatly diminished.</p><p>Because of this understandable stifling of the message, if you are like my Facebook friend and have already experienced the type 2 diabetes cure for yourself \u2014 there are thousands of you out there \u2014 it is important for you to share your success stories as far and wide as possible. You can simply share this post!</p><p>Now, here is the cure. Just follow these three simple rules. If you are taking insulin or other medications, you must coordinate this with your doctor, as dosages will need to be adjusted (downward) so that you don\u2019t die from an overdose.</p><p>1. Absolutely no snacking between meals.</p><p>This seems hard to do, but really it\u2019s not if you know one secret: Replace snacking with something far more satisfying \u2014 fat. That\u2019s right, the government is wrong to recommend a low fat diet. Fat is what makes you feel full until your next meal. Take away the fat, take away the full. Don\u2019t go to an extreme, but do lean strongly toward a high-fat low-carb diet.</p><p>One easy way to increase your fat content and quit snacking is to begin your meal by eating an avocado. I and others I know have used this trick to easily quit snacking. Avocados protect you from one of the reasons some dietary research wrongly claims that high-fat diets are bad for you: the danger of gorging yourself on delicious, fatty foods. With plain avocados, there is little danger of gorging. Another danger is clogging your arteries and giving yourself heart disease. But it\u2019s been amply shown that the blame for that falls squarely on trans fats, like margarine. If you see any product with the words \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d or \u201chydrogenated\u201d in the list of ingredients, put it back, it\u2019s a trans fat. On the other hand, any fat that comes directly from an animal or plant is not a trans fat and can be safely consumed.</p><p>Hint: There may also be benefits to eating the avocado first, as research has shown that the fat literally coats the inside of your intestine, physically blocks other food from being absorbed, and effectively reduces the size of your meal.</p><p>Hint: Using more olive oil in your cooking can also increase healthy fat content during meals and help you eliminate snacking, just like the avocado. Butter also works, and it is very delicious, just don\u2019t overdo it.</p><p>One way to cheat: Coffee and tea, optionally with a bit of cream \u2014 but never with sugar or other sweeteners \u2014 can be used as a snack if you are having an especially hard time lasting til your next meal.</p><p>2. Limit meal times to 1 hour or less, with at least 12 hours between the end of dinner and beginning of breakfast.</p><p>You should have no more than three of these \u201cfeeding times\u201d per day. The reason limiting the number and duration of your meal times is so important has to do with staying out of the vicious cycle of increasing insulin resistance. To get smart on insulin resistance \u2014 the cause of both type 2 diabetes and obesity \u2014 read Dr. Jason Fung\u2019s book, The Obesity Code: Unlocking the Secrets of Weight Loss, or watch his free lecture on YouTube.</p><p>Hint: If you feel like snacking, just wait a bit and make the snack part of your next meal.</p><p>Hint: You never have to count calories again. When you eat, eat until you\u2019re full. I find myself putting down my phone and focusing on the eating. With calorie guilt gone, you can eat what you want and savor it slowly. After years of torturous calorie restriction, eating is really enjoyable again!</p><p>The above two rules are the only dietary rules you need to maintain ideal weight for the rest of your life, assuming you apply common sense and avoid extremes. The diet works by building in regular periods of insulin relief, keeping your body from becoming resistant to insulin. Following these two rules, you will maintain your weight and health by never entering the vicious cycle of increasing insulin resistance.</p><p>HOWEVER, if today you are not your ideal weight (a BMI of about 22), you are already in this vicious cycle and you need to break out of it. In order to break out and quickly get down to your ideal weight, you need one more rule, the rule of using special tricks:</p><p>3. Use additional tricks to accelerate your escape from diabetes and obesity.</p><p>Use any combination of the tricks below to accelerate your weight loss and return to good health. If you use all five wisely, you can get to your ideal weight in 6\u201312 months or less \u2014 even if that means losing 100 pounds or more. Yes, think about your weight 10, 20, 30 years ago. Another friend of mine started on this journey last year weighing 270 pounds. He\u2019s in his mid-thirties and about to reach his college wrestling weight class of 197 pounds and just ran his fastest 2 miles ever. He got to this point by following the two rules above and just 3 of the 5 tricks below.</p><p>Trick (important): Add a teaspoon of vinegar to your first bite of food at every meal. This lowers your blood sugar by 30%. Most people use apple cider vinegar. If you can\u2019t stomach it, a friend who monitors her blood sugar to control gestational diabetes tells me that 5 gherkin pickles also do the trick.</p><p>Trick (important): Cut down on sweets, and if you can, cut them out entirely for a couple months. I still eat ice cream about once a week, and know people who are losing weight on this diet while eating ice cream almost every day. But this probably won\u2019t be the case for everyone. Better to severely restrict sweets for the first few months, and then gradually reintroduce.</p><p>Trick (not as important): Exercise more. Regularly giving your muscles a workout has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity. I say exercise \u201cmore\u201d because if you\u2019re not getting any exercise at all, you\u2019re not even trying and probably haven\u2019t read this far anyway.</p><p>Trick (not as important): Eliminate breakfast. Instead of breakfast, increase the fat, protein, and vegetables you eat at lunch and dinner. I\u2019ve eliminated breakfast while increasing my overall daily calories from 1600 to 2500+, and still lost six pounds in the first two weeks.</p><p>Trick (most important): Go for longer periods of time without eating (yes, yes, fasting). Consume water only for days or weeks at a time. Your fat will literally dissolve away, and with it your type 2 diabetes and other ailments. The definitive books here are Dr. Joel Fuhrman\u2019s, Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor\u2019s Program for Conquering Disease,\u00a0and\u00a0Dr. Jason\u00a0Fung\u2019s\u00a0Complete Guide to Fasting. I highly recommend\u00a0them\u00a0both; if you\u2019re skeptical, read the testimonial comments on Amazon. I and at least 20 of my friends have tried fasts lasting days to weeks. It works, and it is amazing.</p><p>Don\u2019t let anyone discourage you! Your doctor may be skeptical and resist your efforts to cure yourself, but persevere!

Every day.</p><h2>Executive Summary (key points):</h2><ul><li>I am a tech CEO who wanted to have better energy, mood, focus, happiness, confidence, willpower, intelligence, health and longevity.</li><li>Over the last 4\u20135 years, my main hobby has been to get that by hacking my body and mind using a logical, science-based approach.</li><li>As part of that I have optimized my sleep, nutrition and exercise, done thousands of tests, taken dozens of prescription drugs and hundreds of supplements (part of the pills I take every day below), worked with some amazing doctors, meditated >1000 times, did psychotherapy, took MDMA, and spent ~$200,000 on all this.</li></ul><ul><li>The results have been awesome. Objectively I dropped body fat 26%=>10% (data below), got my VO2Max to ~70 (very high), improved lots of biomarkers (some examples also below, lots more here: https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/hundreds-of-biomarkers-i-test-in-pursuit-of-focus-health-energy-confidence-and-happiness-dd01572c518b). And subjectively I feel much happier, calmer, energetic, stable, confident, focused. And intelligent, if you think of intelligence as applied ability to solve complex problems.</li></ul><ul><li>This blog post is an overview of what I do and why. From it I\u2019ll start a bunch of more detailed posts.</li><li>I include a lot of personal health data, test files, what bacteria live in my poop (yes, really). Feel free to share all this. I don\u2019t care about my privacy.</li><li>If you are a journalist or someone looking to discuss personalized health in a public way, I am happy to talk. I think this will have a huge impact on society (and especially significantly increase inequality \u2014 people like me will be able to enhance our performance, increase our wealth, and invest more and more into enhancing our performance further).</li></ul><p>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU THINK CAREFULLY, EVALUATE YOUR OWN HEALTH, AND CONSIDER PROFESSIONAL ADVICE BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT DOING ANY OF THE THINGS I DO. WE ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT AND WHAT WORKS FOR ME MAY BE DANGEROUS OR USELESS FOR YOU. I AM NOT A DOCTOR. THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE. THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL STORY.</p><h2>Briefly about me:</h2><p>Serge Faguet, Russian, 32, Cornell undergrad / Stanford MBA-dropout, started some tech companies (TokBox \u2014 leading B2B video communication infrastructure company bought by Telefonica; Ostrovok \u2014 largest online travel co in Russia, profitable with ~$500m gross turnover in 2017; new stealth-at-this-point AI co in Silicon Valley; been through Ycombinator; worked at Google very briefly).</p><p>Before all this I had a lot of challenges with anxieties, insecurities, introversion, weight, focus, anger management, bad moods, procrastination, and other things that many of us struggle with. Now all of them are effectively gone. I mean, I wrote these two huge posts in one weekend and didn\u2019t procrastinate for a minute.</p><h2>Why I do this stuff:</h2><p>It seems obvious that whatever our goals are in life, certain things can help. I (and many others) want to be more energetic, have better willpower, not have bad moods, have the confidence to talk with the cute girl in the line at the supermarket.</p><p>All these things depend on transient mental states. And they in turn depend on your biochemistry (amongst other things). If you ever meditated, took drugs, had a bad night of sleep, or been sick you know this to be true: with these biochemical fluctuations your personality changes, and behaviors can become much easier or harder.</p><p>My goal is simple: manipulate my biochemistry to get more of the things I want, and less of the things I do not want.</p><h2>What I want:</h2><p>Good mood, confidence, focus, energy, willpower, stress resilience, brainpower, calm, health, longevity, removal of social anxieties/inhibitions. All the time. With minimal investment of time and minimal risk.</p><h2>What I do \u2014 overview:</h2><p>I attack 6 major blocks:</p><p>In this post I will give just an overview of things I feel are most important in each area, and then in future posts will dig in at length.</p><p>Important note: all these go together. You cannot sleep well while eating like shit, not exercising, and stressing out. And you cannot exercise/eat well/not stress out if you sleep badly.</p><p>In all these areas I use roughly the following framework to decide regarding specific tactics:</p><ul><li>Is it scientifically sound? (i.e. are there studies if such are feasible?)</li><li>Is it logically sound? (i.e. is there a sound explanation behind the tactic?)</li><li>Is the estimated cost (risk, money, time/energy) worth the estimated benefit?</li><li>Do independent smart experts (e.g. doctors) agree with the approach? Do they actually practice the approach themselves and with their families?</li><li>Do I track my objective/subjective metrics related to the tactic, if feasible?</li></ul><p>I am actually very conservative and paranoid about these things. For example, I take months to research and talk with people before I decide to take a new compound, start with low doses, and consult with several independent experts. Be careful and don\u2019t screw yourself up with this kind of thing.</p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Get plenty of restorative deep and REM sleep on a regular basis.</p><h2>Key tactics:</h2><ul><li>Measure stages. I heard from private individuals that they compared a lot of devices with a proper sleep lab and the best device for measuring appears to be the Oura Ring. https://ouraring.com/ ; an example of measurements they give is below. I\u2019m quite happy with my metrics, it seems I get a lot of deep sleep although my RHR/HRV used to be better, not sure why.</li></ul><ul><li>Block blue light 3\u20134 hours before sleep. Here is an example of glasses that do that. https://gunnar.com/ (you want the orange-tinted versions)</li><li>Have your bedroom dark (as dark as possible, maybe use an eye mask), cold (18\u201319 celsius) and humid. Consider Chilipad, very useful. https://www.chilitechnology.com/</li><li>Wake at exactly the same time each morning. This is hard, but easier than going to sleep at the same time (which is just impossible).</li><li>Evaluate things that seem to help or disrupt sleep. You won\u2019t be able to do a serious study but you can notice certain trends (e.g. for me even a small amount of alcohol is disruptive; late workouts lead to elevated heart rate etc.)</li></ul><p>This book has more info if you\u2019d like to really dig in http://biohackingbook.com/ (you want the free chapter on sleep, I don\u2019t like the other ones as much)</p><p>Sleep is essential to willpower, which is essential to everything else here.</p><p>Keep in mind that things in other sections will help a lot. In a future post I will dig into a lot more detail and describe my personal journey to better sleep.</p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Eat good stuff. Don\u2019t eat bad stuff. Habituate.</p><h2>Objective (sciencey version):</h2><p>minimize insulin levels, maximize glucose disposal, optimize various growth factors (IGF-1, mTOR etc.) towards things we want (e.g. muscle) and away from what we don\u2019t want (e.g. cancer).</p><h2>Key tactics:</h2><ul><li>Do not eat sugar in any form. Sugar is poison. This means no candy, fruit juices, bread, pasta, honey etc. There are many disagreements about nutrition science. That sugar is extremely bad for you is not one of them.</li><li>Do not eat processed foods. Eat natural food instead.</li><li>Do not eat cheap industrially-farmed animal products.</li><li>Eat mostly plants although I feel going entirely vegetarian for health reasons is not justified.</li><li>Eat organic when possible, especially when discussing animal products. Generally spend more money on food \u2014 the cheaper the food, the more \u201chacks\u201d the producer used to be able to deliver that price. Many of these hacks are harmful \u2014 they inject saline solution to increase weight, feed dead animals to live animals, use antibiotics a lot etc.</li><li>In my opinion one shouldn\u2019t drink any alcohol (screws up sleep) or add any salt (increases blood pressure) to food.</li><li>I do intermittent fasting where for 3 days a week I eat only once a day. You can search for this online, there appears to be a lot of research that suggests this is a good idea. It is also surprisingly easy after the first couple times.</li><li>I also try to eat ketogenic (high-fat-low-carb) but that is very, very hard to achieve.</li></ul><p>Nutrition compliance is generally incredibly hard and may take years to develop. Don\u2019t try to do this all at once, it is too hard. Just try to make small steps to improve. I still occasionally eat bread or pasta or have a glass of wine.</p><p>In a future post, I will describe how I gradually, slowly and very painfully improved in this regard.</p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Maximize metabolic benefits (hormones, insulin sensitivity). Minimize time spent and risk of injury.</p><h2>Key tactics:</h2><ul><li>Warmup. I recommend these articles. Fortunate enough to know both Peter and Jesse and they describe it much better than I ever could. http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live http://eatingacademy.com/personal/move-defines-live-part-ii</li><li>Spend majority of your gym time on hip-hinge exercises \u2014 deadlift, squat, leg press. The logic is that this activates the largest muscles in your body => much more gain than exercising small muscles (e.g. biceps). Important: hip-hinge exercises should be first practiced with a good personal trainer. They are risky because you can damage your lower back.</li></ul><ul><li>HIIT. Basically if you run, walk and do other constant-speed aerobics you should change to high-intensity intervals. They burn less muscle, spend less time, and deliver greater metabolic results. Look online, there is a lot of info about this.</li><li>Minimize sitting. Get a standing desk or something.</li></ul><p>I do the following:</p><ol><li>2\u20133x a week gym with 15 min warmup, 45 min hip-hinge exercise, 30\u201345 min other muscle groups in order of declining size.</li><li>2\u20133x a week on non-gym days 20-min HIIT run: 5 min warmup, 8 sets of 20\u201330 sec all-out, 60\u201390 sec walking, 5 min warmdown. If you do it right, you feel close to sick after this.</li></ol><p>I found gym to be one of the easiest routines to set up. Having personal trainers helped a lot. Now it is such an ingrained habit that I don\u2019t need them anymore.</p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Maximize stress resilience, social support, sense of purpose. Eliminate bad moods.</p><h2>Key tactics:</h2><ul><li>Meditation. It definitely works. This deserves a separate post. But in short, I meditate daily, and found that it has significant benefits. The biggest is that recently I started to realize that the \u201cself\u201d and \u201cfree will\u201d are cognitive illusions, and that makes it very easy to dissipate any negative moods, desires or emotions. I recommend the book Waking Up by Sam Harris here (as long as you are not an easily-offended religious person). https://www.samharris.org/waking-up</li></ul><ul><li>Psychotherapy. Also a separate post. In short, I come to my therapist (who is also a Stanford/Harvard neurobiologist focused on helping high-performance people perform even better) with questions like \u201chow do I enhance my intelligence?\u201d \u201chow do I eliminate bad mood days?\u201d \u201chow do I find it trivially easy to always chat with girls I find attractive?\u201d etc. and we discuss concrete strategies based on research, other high-performer patients he sees etc. If you have not tried psychotherapy you really should, it is awesome.</li></ul><ul><li>Never, ever lie about anything to anyone. Counterintuitive, but this seems to be a huge social hack and people like you a lot more if you always tell everyone the truth, no matter how embarrassing or hurtful. I used to lie a lot and am trying to completely stop. Also recommend the awesome short book \u201cLying\u201d by Sam Harris which outlines this argument better than I ever could. https://www.samharris.org/books/lying</li></ul><ul><li>For me, it took awhile to figure out what I want from sex. Eventually I realized there are two major disagreements I have with how society approaches it, and the key to mental health in my case is to say \u201cfuck social norms,\u201d and just do what you want (as long as all participants consent and nobody is hurt). Specifically:</li></ul><ol><li>I want to be public about my sexual habits, fetishes, porn preferences and the like because I believe they are nothing to be embarrassed of.</li><li>I want to be in relationships with awesome women I find extremely attractive, but at the same time openly (i.e. with everyone\u2019s consent and participation) have sex with other women. Constant sexual novelty/excitement, emotional closeness and complete trust/transparency are all non-negotiable for me. Society says one can\u2019t have it all in this regard. Personal experience and some knowledge of the intimate lives of other people clearly say otherwise.</li></ol><p>I don\u2019t talk much about sense of purpose because I never lacked it. I don\u2019t know how to help discover that.</p><p>Mental health is the most complex of all the things listed here, and is helped by all other sections. So there will be a lot of extra posts on this.</p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Discover your bugs and fix them if possible. Everyone has bugs.</p><h2>Key tactics:</h2><ul><li>Blood testing.</li><li>Genetic testing.</li><li>Other (fat %, CIMT, heart tests, CGM, Toxins, microbiome, allergies). Some of these are useful already, some just fascinating but not clear in terms of actionables.</li></ul><p>I wrote a very detailed separate post that includes a huge number of tests I have done, how I interpret them etc. Read it here, I promise it is very interesting, and it lists hundreds of metrics I consider. It is here: https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/hundreds-of-biomarkers-i-test-in-pursuit-of-focus-health-energy-confidence-and-happiness-dd01572c518b</p><p>Interpretation is hard. This is a new field, the data is very complex, and if you really want to get value out of this, you have to spend a lot of time and effort. It is just the way it is.</p><p>Also if you look at the testing post, you will see that:</p><ol><li>I have not screwed myself up despite all this stuff I do. My health seems to be exceptionally good across a large number of tests I have done, and in fact I appear to biologically be significantly younger than 32 if we use biomarkers as proxies for aging (interesting idea, but not enough data yet for rigorous predictions).</li><li>There is a lot of data out there that can help you understand your risks and how to fix them. It is important to know your metrics.</li></ol><h2>Objective:</h2><p>Depends on the specific intervention.</p><h2>Key tactics I use:</h2><ul><li>Metfromin. This is an anti-diabetes drug that lowers blood sugar without causing hypoglycemia. It appears to be beneficial in preventing cancer and heart disease and is currently in an FDA-approved trial as the first ever treatment for aging. It is extremely safe. I take 1gr morning / 1gr evening of the extended release version.</li></ul><ul><li>Lithium. I use it as a mood stabilizer + as something that may have beneficial cognitive effects. I take ~100\u2013150mg/day lithium carbonate in the evening. Lower doses are unlikely to have noticeable effects. Higher doses may start having negative effects. Lithium is toxic in high doses so something to be careful about.</li></ul><ul><li>Modafinil. Excellent cognitive enhancer. I take 100\u2013200mg/day. Just read this overview in Scientific American: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-safe-drug-to-boost-brainpower/; I have also taken Adderall for many years and found it to cause a lot of problems (anxiety and over-focus on the wrong things) so stopped.</li></ul><ul><li>SSRI antidepressants. I take 10mg escitalopram daily. It makes everything just a little bit nicer and more enjoyable. That is worth a lot to me.</li></ul><ul><li>Thyroid hormones. I take 25mcg T4 + 20mcg T3. I have below-average thyroid hormones and had a noticeable improvement in mood, energy and cognitive function after I started.</li><li>Growth hormone. I take 0.5 ml of somatropin per day as morning injection. My IGF-1 is naturally very low (115\u2013125) and this boosts it to a below-average 160\u2013180. This is controversial because many people try to lower their IGF-1 in order to enhance cancer resistance. The reason I take it is that I decided I have more to gain by raising it a bit and getting better muscle growth/fat disposal. It also may have some cognitive and neuroprotective benefits.</li><li>Estrogen blockler. I take 50mg clomid 3x per week and cycle it on and off. The reason is that I have below-average-ish testosterone with very low LH/FSH. So that part is clearly a bottleneck, and voila \u2014 clomid significantly raises testosterone. I feel more energy and better mood. Also incredibly horny all the time :)</li><li>Phenibut (GABAph). Just started this and don\u2019t really have any data, but subjectively it seems to make sleep a bit more restorative and enjoyable. docparsley.com is the supplement I use.</li></ul><ul><li>MDMA. I will write a whole post about this later. I have only taken it once, and it has been a truly transformative experience that helped me get rid of a lot of social anxieties and become more extroverted and sexually liberated \u2014 all things I really wanted. The effects persist. MDMA is legal in a couple places in the world (e.g. Portugal) plus the FDA is currently running a trial on it for PTSD. It really ought to be legalized.</li><li>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: DO NOT TAKE DRUGS THAT ARE ILLEGAL IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY. DO NOT DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL.</li><li>MEDICAL NOTE: CHECK FOR DRUG INTERACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH MDMA. IN PARTICULAR, MAO INHIBITOR ANTIDEPRESSANTS + MDMA IS LETHAL.</li><li>Supplements. I take a bunch of other compounds that are non-pharmaceuticals. The general idea is that I try to take things that may be beneficial and are unlikely to be harmful. Many of these are likely useless, I just don\u2019t know which ones.</li></ul><p>Above are some of the supplements (not including pharmaceuticals) I currently take. A top-notch medical research team I work with went through a large number of studies related to most of these and felt the ones at the top are quite likely useful, the middle probably useful, and no opinion on the ones at the bottom. None of these supplements were thought at all likely to be harmful.</p><p>Keep in mind: pharmaceuticals act very differently on different people. Some of these may be useless of harmful for you, even if they benefit me. I have gradually phased these in over years of self-experimentation and deep understanding of how they work.</p><p>LEGAL DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT RECOMMENDING YOU TAKE ANY MEDICINE WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SHOULD ONLY BE TAKEN BY PRESCRIPTION FROM A REPUTABLE DOCTOR. I AM NOT A DOCTOR.</p><h2>Closing thoughts:</h2><ul><li>This is a long journey. If you want to get value out of this it will take years. The earlier in life you start, the more compound return benefits you will get.</li><li>All this goes together and reinforces each other. For example if you sleep badly, you can\u2019t do the other things well. You just won\u2019t have the willpower.</li><li>People think of medicine as \u201chealing the sick.\u201d But actually because who is sick is subjective, medicine can also upgrade healthy people on key dimensions. Simple example: I use nearly-invisible hearing aids despite having ok hearing. They boost my hearing to levels significantly above the average human. This can help formulate better responses in conversation, be more persuasive because you hear voice tones better, and many other things that give the user social advantages over others.</li></ul><p>On that note. I think given the way healthcare is organized today, this kind of personalized medicine could significantly increase social inequality beyond where it is now.</p><p>People like me will be able to pay for this out of pocket and use off-label prescriptions from private doctors who focus on upgrading and prevention rather than merely healing. Downstream the extra mood, energy, focus, health, willpower and social skills \u2014 enhanced over decades \u2014 will accrue further and further advantages to people who upgrade themselves, which will lead to a cycle of further concentration of wealth.</p><p>I don\u2019t have any suggestions on this, just pointing out that this will be a far bigger problem than many other social-justice issues that get attention today.</p><h2>In future posts, I plan to go in-depth on:</h2><ul><li>Detailed journeys in food, sleep, meditation.</li><li>Genetic/genomic testing. Seems so promising, yet right now delivers so little actionable value (personal or commercial).</li><li>In-depth descriptions of a couple of my psychotherapy sessions so that people get a sense of how this awesome tool can be used.</li><li>My MDMA experience, how I think about using it as a therapeutic tool in the future, how I think about safety.</li><li>Detailed thoughts around sex. Trying to figure out how to be extremely public and honest about this without being subject to a lot of trolling, or losing business opportunities.</li><li>Enhancing willpower, which is key to all this.</li><li>Discussion of life extension approaches (or rather aging slowdown approaches). I think there is a very good chance we will be able to significantly extend our lives in the near future.</li><li>Human enhancement. There are many things out there already that significantly increase your competitiveness in society. The biggest one is intelligence amplification, which is already possible and which I for one feel I am successfully doing.</li></ul><p>Thanks to everyone who has read this, I hope it has been useful! Also again reminding \u2014 read this other post if you did not already https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/hundreds-of-biomarkers-i-test-in-pursuit-of-focus-health-energy-confidence-and-happiness-dd01572c518b</p><p>I am also happy to speak at high-quality events/podcasts, talk with journalists about all this \u2014 feel free to reach out! Best is to send me a message on Facebook Messenger (https://www.facebook.com/sergef) or Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/sergefaguet/).</p><h1>EDIT: I noticed that very few people read the post about biomarkers. So decided to include it in full below.</h1><h1>Hundreds of biomarkers I test in pursuit of focus, health, energy, confidence and happiness.</h1><p>This post is an in-depth review of hundreds of biomarkers I test with real data and commentary \u2014 insulin resistance, hormones, ketones, microbiome, toxins, athletic capabilities, bodyfat, mercury, allergies and a lot more. The idea is to illustrate the biomarkers I check and ways I interpret them. I have no sense of privacy at all so feel free to use in whatever way you like.</p><p>This is meant to be read together with my main post on biohacking: https://medium.com/@sergefaguet/im-32-and-spent-200k-on-biohacking-became-calmer-thinner-extroverted-healthier-happier-2a2e846ae113</p><p>My interpretation at the end of this is that I am extremely healthy, much younger than my chronological age, perform much better than the vast majority of humans on many dimensions, and will live longer/healthier than anyone who has ever lived as of 2017.</p><p>Bold claims \u2014 partially designed to persuade you to read this long post :) Let\u2019s jump into it.</p><p>Cholesterols:</p><ul><li>All except Lp(a) in optimal territory, some significantly better. I should add that this is despite the fact that I eat an extremely high-fat ketogenic diet, so at least for me the idea that cholesterol raises cholesterol is clearly false.</li><li>Particle numbers are more important than milligrams / deciliter.</li><li>Lp(a) is an annoying genetic factor that helps blood clotting and significantly increases cardio risks. It can\u2019t be fixed at the moment, but there are drugs on the horizon that target this and that I will take. This is the perfect illustration that we were designed for a different world where wounds were a greater risk than heart disease. And that it is time to take matters into our own hands.</li></ul><p>Excellent on inflammation markers \u2014 way better than suggested optima, CRP below detection limit. There is a lot of evidence that suggests inflammation is key in all major aging diseases (cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative disease) so happy to see this. Everyone should know their inflammation markers.</p><p>Also great on endothelial function which is key for preventing heart disease.</p><p>Here should mention some key genetics things you should be aware of, especially your ApoE (key to Alzheimers risk) and MTHFR (which is what screws up my B12 metabolism).</p><p>My TSH is actually not great, the lab is wrong to consider that optimal. Optimal is under 2, so my thyroid is working a bit harder than it should. Wrong lab range is partially because reference ranges are based on sick people.</p><p>You should know your Vitamin D and homocysteine. My Vitamin D started at around ~24 and I supplemented it up. My homocysteine started at ~12 and I supplemented it down into optimal territory with a lot of B-vitamins. Both markers have significant associations with key diseases</p><p>(credit www.marksdailyapple.com \u2014 a great blog about health!)</p><p>The screen above shows data compiled from a bunch of studies suggesting that relatively high levels of Vitamin D are protective against a number of diseases. It is very unlikely you will get to these levels without supplementing unless you are a lifeguard on a beach in Israel.</p><p>Here the most important thing is that I have exceptional kidney function (eGFR and Cystatin-C) \u2014 in the top 5\u201310% of people in my age group. Especially important for me because all my supplements add workload on kidneys. eGFR is one of the key markers evaluated to calculate people\u2019s \u201ctrue biological age.\u201d</p><p>This all mostly has to do with insulin sensitivity which is one of the most key pathways in the body in terms of staving off aging and disease. My baseline glucose, insulin and HbA1c are actually not that great, but they don\u2019t matter as much.</p><p>What matters the most is the OGTT (\u201cPostprandial Evaluation\u201d in the image above) \u2014 a test where you measure markers, then ingest a lot of fast sugar, then measure again couple more times after defined periods. This test shows the dynamics of how efficiently your body gets rid of sugar. In my case, it is extremely good \u2014 basically drinking 75mg of a very sugary solution has barely elevated my sugar, and then a small amount of insulin removed a huge amount of glucose out of my blood, taking me down to 46mg/dl. Most people would feel quite hypoglycemic here but I don\u2019t because my sugar is constantly low and my body is used to it.</p><p>Alpha-hydroxybutyrate is raised because of my ketogenic diet.</p><p>Ferritin is fairly low because I eat well and give blood to do all these tests! This is quite key, especially for men. Lower iron is hypothesized to be one of the reasons why women live longer.</p><p>OK, so more on insulin/glucose pathways. Sorry about the Russian in the images. Above is a test called RQ (respiratory quotient) of how much oxygen/co2 you process at rest (you basically put on a gas exchange mask that is also used for VO2max tests below, and sit calmly). What it tells me is that my body runs 85\u2013100% entirely on fat, a little on protein, and not at all on carbs. Which is exactly what you want. I start using the carbs in my body as a dominant energy source only after I get to >150 heartbeats/minute. This enhances athletic performance since glucose storage in the body is limited.</p><p>(credit Peter Attia @ http://eatingacademy.com \u2014 great blog by one of the most knowledgeable people about preventative medicine in the world, in particular about insulin resistance and ketogenic diets)</p><p>If you read up about how cancer cells preferentially eat sugar, how ketogenic diets are more metabolically efficient and generate less waste byproducts per unit of energy etc., you will see that keeping your insulin/glucose pathways extremely optimized is an interesting opportunity for material life and healthspan extension. Not to mention body fat % reduction. This also deserves a whole separate post.</p><p>On that note, here is my body fat graph. This was done in 33 separate measurements by the same personal trainer with the same equipment via measuring ~15 different sites for subcutaneous fat with calipers. This is error-prone. DEXA scans are better, but we didn\u2019t have easy equipment access on a constant basis.</p><p>I think the absolute values are suspect, and bioimpedance suggests I am in the 10\u201311% range right now rather than ~7%. But the directional trend is very clear and encouraging. Also cool that I actually barely lost any weight, so I added a lot of muscle which has major health benefits (if you want a great detailed book on how muscle enhances your health, read https://www.amazon.com/Body-Science-Research-Program-Results-ebook/dp/B001NLL38S/).</p><p>I don\u2019t good have before-and-after pics but I definitely used to be chubby, as all my friends and employees are delighted to keep reminding me :)</p><p>Also for those that are interested in ketogenic diets, you measure them via glucometers + ketometers similar to mine above. Be warned that keto blood strips are quite expensive. And that actually getting to a level of ketosis like mine above (after a ~16hr fast) will take a long time and a lot of work.</p><p>Also you can use CGM \u2014 an implant that tracks your glucose in real-time and sends data to your iphone. This can help figure out which exact foods, activities etc. alter your glucose and are harmful. The above image is from a night a couple years ago when I was stressed, stayed up late, and ate a lot of chocolate while sitting in a bathtub. Note how big the late-night jump is relative to the increase with good food around 6pm. This graph very clearly and unambiguously tells me \u201chey dude, you are fucking yourself by eating this sugary garbage. Like you just fucked yourself right now \u2014 look, let me show you in real-time how you are damaging your health!\u201d Motivational stuff.</p><p>CGMs are very cool, but expensive (the Dexcom G5 I used was >$4,000) and a huge hassle. I do think this is the future and plan to use them a lot though. Imagine real-time monitoring of testosterone connected to a pump that keeps it at optimal levels depending on time of day or activity! This is already feasible (albeit not with all molecules), someone just needs to engineer it.</p><p>OK, back to more blood testing! Some notes:</p><ul><li>My liver markers are great, which is also important in my case because of all the load my supplements and meds put on the liver. People often ask me how I know all these pills don\u2019t screw up my liver. This is how I know.</li><li>Hormones deserve an entire separate post. Mine are not great, the hypothesis is that this is due to a childhood head trauma interfering with the pituitary\u2019s function. For example my brother has very similar Lp(a), homocysteine etc problems, but he is much taller than me, which suggests childhood environmentally-driven growth hormone disruption.</li></ul><p>As I mention in my main framework post, I boost thyroid hormones, IGF-1 and testosterone.</p><p>Testosterone deserves a special mention. In short, I have average-ish testosterone but low LH/FSH (which serve as inputs to testosterone). What controls FSH/LH is binding of estrogen at the pituitary gland. And because estrogen is a testosterone downstream product, there is a feedback loop.</p><p>So what I did is take an \u201cestrogen blocker\u201d which competitively occupies the same sites estrogen occupies at the pituitary, without inhibiting FSH/LH. The result can clearly be seen above \u2014 in a very short period of time (2 months), free testosterone jumped a lot. This has a noticeable effect on mood and energy. Also very noticeable effect on wanting to have sex all the time:)</p><p>This is a basic blood panel. Nothing too interesting, you basically just do these to make sure nothing is screwed up.</p><p>I have high EPA/DHA and Omega 3s in general + low Omega 6 and trans fats. Result of great diet + supplementation. This is basically what you want too.</p><p>OK, so in the graph above you can see I had elevated mercury and got rid of it. The hypothesis is that it is due to a dental amalgam. I fixed it by stopping eating any large predatory fish + enhancing liver detox capabilities via B-vitamins and the like.</p><p>Mercury is likely to interfere with a lot of neurobiological processes and contribute to many issues such as mood disorders. Good riddance.</p><p>This is a CIMT test. It basically shows the thickness of your neck arteries, which appears to be very predictive of cardio risks a long time in advance. Another factor that suggests that my lifestyle approach is working. The cool thing is that this compares you with people in your own age demographic, so I know that unless something changes, I should have low cardio risk even when I am 85. Cool test, non-invasive, highly recommended.</p><p>VO2Max is a measure of how your body performs in terms of gas exchange, and as such evaluates the capabilities of your cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. You measure it by exercising while wearing respiratory gas analysis equipment as in the photo of me above. As the quotes from New York Times above highlight, it appears to significantly predict lifespan and \u201cfitness age.\u201d</p><p>My VO2Max has risen a lot over time and is very high, not far from Olympic medalist levels although I have just about zero athletic accomplishments. I mostly credit high-intensity interval training and weights training, but I don\u2019t really know. More recently in a period when I stopped doing HIIT, I saw this metric worsen. Another good indicator that I\u2019m doing something right though.</p><p>The above is from a test called \u201cGI Effects\u201d by Genova Diagnostics. It tests your poop (which is very fun to mail) for bacteria, parasites, metabolites and a lot of other interesting things.</p><p>I think this is a very fascinating test, but I have no idea how to really use it yet beyond \u201cdo not take antibiotics, do take probiotics & prebiotics\u201d. Microbiome is a super exciting new frontier of health, but we don\u2019t know whether certain microbes cause health states or simply correlate with them. If you want to learn more, take this great class on Coursera which I did and learned a lot from https://www.coursera.org/learn/microbiome</p><p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzeKcwaaUlObZlhEWFotenk4d0U/view?usp=sharing</p><p>Anyway, my latest entire test is linked to above. Now the entire internet knows exactly what bacterial strains live in my poop as of 2017. Enjoy :)</p><p>This is an interesting test (Genova Diagnostic Toxic Effects) that suggests somewhere I was getting significant exposure to VOCs (which are definitely bad for you). The actions I took were to enhance office/home ventilation, not eat/drink from plastic containers, not stand next to people who smoke.</p><p>On that last note, one time I took this test after smoking some pure-weed joints (which I do very rarely), and the toxins went off the charts high. If you can\u2019t stop smoking, at least vape. Inhaling burned weed or tobacco is incredibly bad for you, I was shocked by the levels of toxic chemicals I saw in myself after just one evening of several joints.</p><p>This is from two tests of allergies/sensitivities by Cyrex. The reason I took it is that if you eat products you are sensitive to, you may increase inflammatory activity in the body which we do not want.</p><p>My takeaways are that I shouldn\u2019t eat tuna or scallops, and that I am allergic to certain molds. Also that I appear to have a clearly-acquired gelatin sensitivity because of all the capsules I take. Fascinating.</p><p>Other interesting tests/metrics:</p><ul><li>Resting heart rate at night. You can measure via the Oura ring or many other devices. Mine is around 55 which is ok, but not great. Kind of irritates me that it isn\u2019t better :)</li><li>heart rate variability is an interesting metric that appears to be correlated with health even more than RHR, although I have no idea how to interpret it at this point.</li><li>Blood pressure. Should ideally be on the low end. Mine is typically around 100/60. Can be improved by eating less salt + drinking hibiscus tea, as well as by a lot of the other lifestyle things I list.</li></ul><p>There are many other tests I have done, but this is already an incredibly long post.</p><p>The key takeaways are that:</p><ol><li>I have not screwed my health up despite all this crazy stuff I do. In fact, my health seems to be exceptionally good across a large number of tests I have done \u2014 a lot of age-correlated markers suggest I am closer to 20 years old, even though I am 32. The markers are also continuing to improve. This suggests I am doing something right.</li><li>There is a lot of data out there that can help you understand your risks and how to fix them. It is important to know your metrics.</li></ol><p>Also here is a framework I like using. Below are all-age causes of death in the US. My markers suggest that I am at extremely low risk for a large number of them, even in my age group. So if I maintain a similar set of behaviors (and actually I keep improving every year) I should have low risks in my age group when I am 80 as well unless something screws up.</p><p>With the above framework I also identified that my key risk is cancer \u2014 which is why I am so focused on low sugar and insulin (which appear to feed cancer preferentially, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_hypothesis) and my immune system which is somewhat weaker due to CMV, so very interested in iP stem cell therapies that could replenish naive lymphocytes.</p><p>I expect that even without major medical progress, I will be in excellent mental/physical condition at 100 and will live longer than any human who has ever lived as of 2017. With tech progress, it seems likely that immortality is reachable.</p><p>I could be wrong, but I suspect that today there are fewer than 1000 people out of 7 billion who know as much about their own health as I do. Because of how onerous, expensive, and non-intuitive this is.</p><p>But this should become much more mainstream. It really does give you a significant advantage in life across very many areas \u2014 thanks to this, I often feel \u201csuperhuman\u201d because of how much control I have over my health and behavior relative to what I see in other people. And humans tend to adopt things that enhance their social competitiveness.</p><p>I am happy to speak at high-quality events/podcasts, talk with journalists about personalized patient-driven medicine etc. \u2014 feel free to reach out!

Read this thoroughly before you start, the manufacturer would implore. There would be detailed setup procedures and troubleshooting guides.</p><p>Most of us ignored the manual, just plugged it in and tried to figure out the rest. That\u2019s why we all had the blinking 12:00 on. Today, most new electronics now come with a quick start guide which has the most basic 4 or 5 steps to get your machine working and then anything else you needed, you could reference the detailed instruction manual. Instruction manuals are just so much more useful this way.</p><p>Well, I don\u2019t know much about VCRs, but I do know about type 2 diabetes. I could write an entire book about obesity (oh, wait, I did that already), or fasting (oh, wait, done too) or type 2 diabetes (next up for 2018). But many of you will not want to go through the entire instruction manual. So this is your quick start guide for reversing your type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A Fully Reversible Disease</p><p>Most doctors, dietitians and diabetes specialists claim that type 2 diabetes is a chronic and progressive disease. The American Diabetes Association, for example, almost proudly proclaims this on its website. Once you get the diagnosis, it\u2019s a life sentence. But, it\u2019s actually a great big lie. Type 2 diabetes is almost always reversible and this is almost ridiculously easy to prove. This is great news for the more than 50% of American adults who have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes or diabetes. Recognizing this truth is the crucial first step in reversing your diabetes or pre-diabetes. Actually, it something that most people already instinctively recognized to be true.</p><p>Suppose your friend is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, then works hard to lose 50 pounds. He takes himself off all his medications and his blood sugars are now normal. What would you say to him? Probably something like \u201cGreat job. You\u2019re really taking care of yourself. Keep it up!\u201d What you wouldn\u2019t say is something like \u201cYou\u2019re such a dirty, filthy liar. My doctor says this is a chronic and progressive disease so you must be lying \u201d. It seems perfectly obvious that diabetes reversed because your friend lost all that weight. And that\u2019s the point. The disease is reversible.</p><p>We\u2019ve known all this along. But only diet and lifestyle changes will reverse it. NOT medications. The most important thing, of course, is to lose weight. But the diabetes medications don\u2019t do this. Quite the contrary. Insulin, for example is notorious for causing weight gain. Patients intuitively sense that they are heading down the wrong path.</p><p>They would often say to me, \u201cDoctor. You\u2019ve always said that weight loss is the key to reversing diabetes. Yet you prescribed me a drug that made me gain 25 pounds. How is that good?\u201d I never had a good answer, because none existed. The truth was that insulin was not good for type 2 diabetes \u2014 it was only good for reducing blood glucose. The key was weight loss, whereupon the diabetes often goes away or at least gets significantly better. So, logically, insulin does not help reverse the disease, but actually worsens it.</p><p>Other medications such as metformin or the DPP4 drug class are weight neutral. While this won\u2019t make things worse, they won\u2019t make things better either. Since weight loss is the key to reversing type 2 diabetes, medications won\u2019t make things better. Medications make blood sugars (the symptom) better, but not the diabetes (the actual disease). We\u2019ve been pretending that the symptom is the disease.We can pretend the disease is better, but that doesn\u2019t make it true. That\u2019s the reason most doctors think type 2 diabetes a chronic and progressive disease. We\u2019ve been using the wrong treatment. We\u2019ve been prescribing drugs for a dietary disease. No wonder it doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>So, how can you reverse your type 2 diabetes?</p><p>The Sugar Bowl</p><p>The essential feature of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes is that our bodies are completely filled with sugar. It\u2019s not just too much sugar in the blood. That\u2019s only part of the problem. There\u2019s too much sugar in our entire body. Imagine our bodies to be a sugar bowl. A bowl of sugar. When we are young, our sugar bowl is empty. Over decades, we eat too much of the wrong things \u2014 sugary cereals, desserts and white bread. The sugar bowl gradually fills up with sugar until completely full. The next time you eat, sugar comes into the body, but the bowl is full, so it spills out into the blood.</p><p>Insulin is a normal hormone produced when we eat and its job is to allow glucose into the cells. When it is no longer able to do it, glucose piles up outside the cell in the blood, and it is called insulin resistance.</p><p>But why does this happen? The cells are already over-filled with glucose (see previous post \u2014 A New Paradigm, and Insulin Resistance is Good?). Like trying to blow air into an over-inflated balloon, it simply takes more force. The cell resists the glucose because it\u2019s completely full. insulin resistance is an overflow phenomenon.</p><p>It\u2019s like packing your clothes into a suitcase. At first, the clothes go without any trouble. After a certain point, though, it is just impossible to jam in those last 2 T-shirts. You can\u2019t close the suitcase. The luggage is now \u2018resistant\u2019 to the clothes. It\u2019s waaayyy harder to put those last 2 T-shirts than the first 2. It\u2019s the same overflow phenomenon. The cell is filled to bursting with glucose, so trying to force more in is difficult and requires much higher doses of insulin.</p><p>When the insulin levels are unable to keep up with the increasing resistance, blood sugars rise and your doctor diagnoses you with type 2 diabetes and starts you on a pill, such as metformin. But metformin does not get rid of the sugar. Instead, it simply takes the sugar from the blood and rams it back into the liver. The liver doesn\u2019t want it either, so it ships it out to all the other organs \u2014 the kidneys, the nerves, the eyes, the heart. Much of this extra sugar will also just get turned into fat.</p><p>The problem, of course, has not been solved \u2014 the sugar bowl is still overflowing. You\u2019ve only moved sugar from the blood (where you could see it) into the body (where you couldn\u2019t see it). It\u2019s putting a band-aid over a bullet hole. So, the very next time you eat, the exact same thing happens. Sugar comes in, spills out into the blood and you take medication to cram the sugar back into the body. This works for a while, but eventually, the body fills up with sugar, too. Now, that same dose of medication cannot force any more sugar into the body.</p><p>So you go to your doctor. What does he do? Instead of getting rid of the toxic sugar load, he doubles the dose of the medication. If the luggage doesn\u2019t close, the solution is to empty it out, not use more force to . The higher dose of medication helps, but only for a time. Blood sugars go down as you force your body to gag down even more sugar. But eventually, this dose fails as well. So then your doctor gives you a second medication, then a third one and then eventually insulin injections.</p><p>Over a period of years, you went from pre-diabetes, to diabetes, to taking one medication, then two then three and then finally large doses of insulin. Here\u2019s the thing. If you are taking more and more medications to keep your blood sugars at the same level, your diabetes is getting worse! Even if your blood sugars get better, your diabetes is getting worse. This is unfortunately what happens to virtually every patient. The body is already overflowing with sugar. The medications only hide the blood sugar by cramming it into the engorged body.</p><p>The diabetes looks better, since you can only see the blood sugars. Doctors can congratulate themselves on a illusion of a job well done, even as the patient gets continually sicker. Patients require ever increasing doses of medications and yet still suffer with heart attacks, congestive heart failure, strokes, kidney failure, amputations and blindness. \u201cOh well\u201d the doctor tells himself, \u201cIt\u2019s a chronic, progressive disease\u201d.</p><p>Imagine that you hide your kitchen garbage under the rug instead throwing it outside in the trash. You can\u2019t see it, so you can pretend your house is clean. When there\u2019s no more room underneath the rug, you throw the garbage into your bedroom, and bathroom, too. Anywhere where you don\u2019t have to see it. Eventually, it begins to smell. Really, really bad. You needed to throw out the garbage, not hide it away. If we understand that too much sugar in the blood is toxic, why can\u2019t we understand that too much sugar in the body is toxic too?</p><p>The End Game</p><p>What happens over time \u2014 10, 20 years?</p><p>Every single part of the body just starts to rot. This is precisely why type 2 diabetes, unlike virtually any other disease, affects every part of our body. Every organ suffers the long term effects of the excessive sugar load. Your eyes rot \u2014 and you go blind. Your kidneys rot \u2014 and you need dialysis. You heart rots \u2014 and you get heart attacks and heart failure. Your brain rots \u2014 and you get Alzheimers disease. Your liver rots \u2014 and you get fatty liver disease. Your legs rot \u2014 and you get diabetic foot ulcers. Your nerves rot \u2014 and you get diabetic neuropathy. No part of your body is spared.</p><p>Medications and insulin do nothing to slow down the progression of this organ damage, because they do not eliminate the toxic sugar load from our body. We\u2019ve known this inconvenient fact since 2008. No less than 7 multinational, multi-centre, randomized controlled trials of tight blood glucose control with medications (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT, ORIGIN, TECOS, ELIXA, SAVOR) failed to demonstrate reductions in heart disease, the major killer of diabetic patients. We pretended that using medications to lower blood sugar makes people healthier. But it\u2019s only been a lie. You can\u2019t use drugs to cure a dietary disease.</p><p>How to Reverse Diabetes</p><p>Once we understand type 2 diabetes, then the solution becomes pretty bloody obvious. If we have too much sugar in the body, then get rid of it. Don\u2019t simply use medications to hide it away so we can\u2019t see it. There are really only two ways to get rid of the excessive sugar in the body.</p><ol><li>Don\u2019t put sugar in.</li><li>Burn it off.</li></ol><p>That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we need to do. The best part? It\u2019s all natural and completely free. No drugs. No surgery. No cost.</p><p>Step 1 \u2014 Don\u2019t put sugar in</p><p>The first step is to eliminate all sugar and refined starches from your diet. Sugar has no nutritional value and can therefore be eliminated. Starches are simply long chains of sugars. Highly refined starches such as flour or white rice are quickly broken down by digestion into glucose. This is quickly absorbed into the blood and raises blood sugar. For example, eating white bread increases blood sugars very quickly. Doesn\u2019t it seem self-evident that we should avoid foods that raise blood sugars because they will eventually be absorbed into the body? The optimum strategy is to eat little or no refined carbohydrates.</p><p>Most importantly, stick to eating whole, natural, unprocessed foods.</p><p>Step 2 \u2014 Burn it off</p><p>Fasting is the simplest and fastest method to force your body to burn sugar for energy. Glucose in the blood is the most easily accessible source of energy for the body. Fasting is merely the flip side of eating \u2014 if you are not eating you are fasting. When you eat, your body stores food energy. When you fast, your body burns food energy. If you simply lengthen out your periods of fasting, you can burn off the stored sugar.</p><p>Since type 2 diabetes is merely excessive glucose in the body, burning it off will reverse the disease. While it may sound severe, fasting has been practiced for at least 2000 years. It is the oldest dietary therapy known. Literally millions of people throughout human history have fasted without problems. If you are taking prescription medications, you should seek the advice of a physician. But the bottom line comes to this.</p><p>If you don\u2019t eat, will your blood sugars come down? Of course.</p><p>If you don\u2019t eat, will you lose weight? Of course.</p><p>So, what\u2019s the problem? None that I can see.</p><p>We can reverse type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes today, right now, immediately. All without cost, without drugs, without surgery, with an all natural, time-tested healing method. We only need to lead our bodies down the healing pathway and have the courage to apply our hard-won knowledge. Type 2 diabetes is reversible. A new hope arises.</p>", "tags": ["Health"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*rO16Pz6DxyDNCRjLbF0bOA.jpeg"], "url": "https://gidmk.medium.com/8-common-arguments-against-vaccines-5d45ad9c1e29", "dateCreated": "2017-09-09T11:48:05.717Z", "datePublished": "2017-09-09T11:48:05.717Z", "dateModified": "2019-09-24T10:17:32.250Z", "headline": "8 Common Arguments Against Vaccines - Gideon M-K; Health Nerd - Medium", "name": "8 Common Arguments Against Vaccines - Gideon M-K; Health Nerd - Medium", "description": "Being an argumentative sort of person, every once in a while* I find myself getting into a spot of witty repartee.

It usually happens on twitter, the land of the 140-character he-said/she-said/THE-GOVERNMENT-IS-OUT-TO-GET-YOU banter, but occasionally I find myself getting into arguments in other places online, or even in real life.</p><p>Often these arguments are over the subject of vaccines. Because whilst vaccines have been accepted by public health organisations the world over as the most important medical innovation of the 20th century, and one of the most lifesaving interventions that we\u2019ve ever come up with, there is a small minority of people who are convinced that vaccines are bad for their child\u2019s health.</p><p>A small, very vocal, minority.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m not here to criticize parents. It\u2019s very important to note that most parents want the best for their kids. They are trying to look out for their children, and occasionally in this pursuit they get misled. And make no mistake, the people who sell vaccine fear are professionals in the art of deception. They know exactly how to convince a worried parent that the most dangerous thing in the world for their child is the vaccine, rather than, say, the measles.</p><p>It\u2019s not the parents who are spreading vaccine denial. They are victims of professionals. If you are a parent who is worried about vaccination: don\u2019t stress. You are a good parent. You have just been lied to. Have a read of this article, and maybe go have a chat with your doctor about why immunization is important and why it\u2019s a good thing for your kids.</p><p>Whenever you talk vaccines, the anti-vax professionals come up with the same arguments time and again. Here are my top 8, and why they make no sense whatsoever:</p><p>8Vaccines Cause Autism. I\u2019m not really going to go into this, because it has been refuted time and again. Virtually every study involving a) humans, b) more than 10 participants, and c) researchers who haven\u2019t been convicted of fraud, has shown that there is no link between vaccines and autism. It was a valid concern in the early 90s, but we have 30 years of evidence showing that autism is in no way linked to vaccines.</p><p>VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM ALL REPUTABLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS FOR DECADES</p><p>7There Hasn\u2019t Been Much Research. This is always a bit of a weird one, because people are usually claiming that on the one hand there hasn\u2019t been enough research done on vaccines to prove them safe, but on the other they know the truth because they\u2019ve done their research and it shows vaccines to be basically poison.</p><p>It\u2019s a strange argument to make, but it comes up all the time.</p><p>This is simply a lie told by vaccine-deniers to make parents scared. Vaccines are one of the most well-researched interventions of all time. We have data from literally millions of children across the world demonstrating their safety. There has been more research on vaccines than almost any other medical intervention.</p><p>The research has been done. Time and again. Vaccines are safe and effective.</p><p>6Vaccines Are Enormously Profitable. This is also a weird one, because\u2026so what? So are any number of things. The international flour market is gigantic, but that doesn\u2019t make every bread advert a missive from the devil. Flour millers have actually been influential in protecting babies worldwide by fortifying their products with macronutrients and preventing neural tube defects.</p><p>It\u2019s also untrue. Pharma companies make far more money from so-called \u2018blockbuster\u2019 drugs than vaccines \u2014 for example, Astrazeneca\u2019s Nexium, despite being no more effective than cheaper options for gastrointestinal problems, has made them more than $50 billion. The yearly earnings have been somewhere between 2 and 5 times as much as the flu vaccine. In fact, if you look at the top 20 earners for pharma companies, not one of them is a vaccine.</p><a>Source</a><p>5Vaccines Cost Loads. Perhaps more importantly than this, however: vaccines don\u2019t cost much at all. Take the whooping cough vaccine. A full 3 doses costs around 100 USD. That seems like quite a bit, until you remember that a single case of whooping cough can easily top $10,000 if it requires significant treatment.</p><p>Vaccines are actually cost-saving. What this means is that for every dollar you spend on vaccines, you get about seven dollars back because you stop people from getting sick and dying from their illnesses. Generally speaking, it would be much more profitable for the medical industry to not vaccinate, because disease tends to be really expensive.</p><p>4The CDC Is Lying. This is one of my favourite red herrings, because it is just so easy to disprove. Whenever someone brings up the CDC, my response is\u2026so what? Let\u2019s say the CDC is evil, awful, in the pocket of Big Pharma. It\u2019s not \u2014 the people who work at the CDC are dedicated, honest, and usually incredibly good at public health \u2014 but for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say the CDC is corrupt.</p><p>Who cares?</p><p>People who focus on the CDC ignore one glaring truth: the US isn\u2019t the only country in the world. If the CDC is corrupt, what about every other public health organisation in the world that recommends vaccines. Australia. France. The UK. Japan. China. The list goes on. Forget about the CDC. Have a look at the Australian Department of Health on vaccines. Or the Japanese immunization schedule. Or one of hundreds of other countries that all choose to vaccinate. Either there\u2019s a global conspiracy including countries that are literally at war with one another \u2014 a bit unlikely \u2014 or immunization is a good thing no matter what you think of the CDC.</p><a>actually really good</a><p>3The US Is Special. This is another one that I love, because it\u2019s so easily disprovable. No, the US doesn\u2019t give a uniquely high number of immunizations. Much of the OECD has a virtually identical vaccine schedule to the US, bar a few minor differences. The US also has significantly less punitive laws in terms of vaccination than other countries \u2014 for example, in France you can go to jail for failing to vaccinate your kids.</p><p>So no. The US isn\u2019t special. It\u2019s just another country, trying to stop nasty diseases like polio, diptheria and measles from killing children.</p><p>2Vaccine Manufacturers Can\u2019t Be Sued For Making Kids Sick. This is actually a very simple lie. You can sue whoever you want, even in the US. What the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act actually does is make it much easier to get compensation for children who have suffered vaccine injuries. If you can demonstrate that you had a vaccine and suffered a recognized issue \u2014 let\u2019s say anaphylaxis \u2014 there is a reasonably simple method of gaining access to compensation in the US.</p><p>Elsewhere in the world, for example Australia, often all you can do is sue in civil courts. And even if you\u2019ve suffered genuine harm from vaccination, proving this in a court of law is next to impossible, meaning that people who do suffer injuries are almost never compensated.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that saying \u201cvaccine manufacturers can\u2019t be sued\u201d is again a uniquely American piece of nonsense. There are hundreds of other countries. Most of them allow anyone to try and sue anyone. And yet, the UK court system isn\u2019t flooded with cases of vaccine manufacturers being successfully sued.</p><p>I wonder why?</p><p>1Vaccine Injury Is Common/People Are Getting Sicker. Last but not least, the most common one of the bunch. Forget the CDC, forget the pharmaceutical companies, this is the real evil.</p><p>Every year, people are getting sicker. And it\u2019s all down to vaccines.</p><p>There are two parts to this story. Firstly, we aren\u2019t getting sicker. Not even a little bit. Life expectancy is marching steadily upward, with some people predicting that we will be living past 100 in this century. Not only that, but infant and child mortality is at record lows, and is only heading swiftly down. This isn\u2019t just true for wealthy countries mind you \u2014 the entire world is getting stubbornly healthier.</p><p>Secondly, vaccine injury is an amazingly well-researched field. We know the rate of injuries associated with vaccines all too well. It\u2019s roughly 1 serious problem for every million vaccinations given. This is a number that has been replicated worldwide, from Japan to Thailand to Australia to Finland and yes, to the US.</p><p>Contrast this with the rate of serious problems from, say, measles, which is around 1 problem for every 4 people infected, and you can see why vaccines are so important!</p><h2>Vaccines Rock</h2><p>There\u2019s not really much more to say. These are common arguments, mostly just based on simple lies. Vaccines are safe and effective, not because pharmaceutical companies say it\u2019s so or because the CDC has proclaimed it, but because thousands of dedicated researchers the world over have spent decades checking to make sure that they are.</p><p>So go and get your kids vaccinated. It\u2019s good for society, it will save us all money, but most of all it might save their life.</p><p>Vaccines rock.</p><p>It\u2019s as simple as that.</p><p>You can now listen to more Health Nerd on the Sensationalist Science podcast:</p><p>If you enjoyed and/or like vaccines, send some claps my way with the button below!

I used to wake up in a fog, feeling just as tired as when I went to bed, and immediately I began to fear the inevitable feeling that creeps into your stomach and throat\u2026</p><p>\u2026here it is again, I would think to myself as I pulled the covers over my head. Fearing that this is how I would feel every single morning for the rest of my life. No confidence that I could ever make myself feel better.</p><p>I had always heard about how the most successful people like Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss, and Ben Franklin had daily, morning routines that helped them wake up energized and ready to take on the day. But in the midst of my anxiety, the thought of waking up at 4 am to hustle was the last thing on my mind. I needed to find a way to model the morning routines of the most successful people in business in a way that was focused on decreasing my stress & anxiety.</p><p>I realized the \u201cmorning routine\u201d I used to follow was setting me up for increased anxiety and failure throughout my day.</p><p>I would wake up. Snooze my alarm a couple of times. Then finally open my eyes to face the day. Immediately, I would check all of my \u201csocials\u201d to assure myself that I had not missed anything. After realizing that no one had liked me throughout the night, I would get out of bed, take a shower, down a cup of coffee, and run off to work.</p><p>No structure. No purpose. No peace.</p><p>It was no wonder why I would arrive to work completely stressed out. I was setting myself up for failure by not being intentional with how I operated my day.</p><p>After reading an incredible article by Benjamin P. Hardy on Medium, I decided to finally try out a morning routine. My morning routine would be focused solely on lowering my anxiety, instead of increasing it.</p><h1>Why a morning routine?</h1><p>Because It Can Massively Reduce Anxiety</p><p>When I implemented an effective morning routine and stuck to it, I was able to massively reduce my anxiety. In addition, it also helped with my productivity, energy, relationships, and a host of other areas of my life. It truly was life-changing.</p><p>I wish there had been a list like this when I was first battling with anxiety during my senior year of college. On most nights I was going to bed after 2. I would procrastinate anything that felt remotely difficult in fear it may trigger more panic. And my mornings were always a nightmare. It was my daily reminder of that I had a problem.</p><p>However, something happened once I began working on my personal development, I started to view my mornings as a gift rather than a nightmare. I begin to trigger my brain, from the moment I first opened my eyes, to see the beauty in my life.</p><p>Creating a morning routine has been the single most important strategy for lowering my stress and anxiety that I have implemented over the last year. It has allowed me to get more done than I ever thought possible, while also helping to keep me grounded throughout the day.</p><p>Once you begin starting your day off on a positive, structured, and intentional note, you will be amazed by the reduction in your anxiety as well as the other benefits you will receive.</p><p>With this short morning routine, your anxiety will start to drop and your life will become enhanced.</p><h1>10 Things You Can Do to Naturally Heal Your Anxiety and Stress today</h1><ol><li>Wake Up Early</li><li>Make Your Bed</li><li>Meditate / Pray</li><li>Take a Cold Shower</li><li>Go For a Walk</li><li>Brain Dump at Desk</li><li>Gratitude</li><li>Morning Three</li><li>MITs</li><li>Deep Work</li></ol><p>Let\u2019s Do This.</p><h1>1. Wake up between 5:30\u20136:00</h1><p>According to Hannah Hepworth, an expert on natural anxiety relief, \u201cwhen you wake up early you can have plenty of time to get where you need to go. Instead of rushing and yelling\u2026you can work calmly.\u201d</p><p>Getting up early to simply \u201ccrush it\u201d is not a good idea. But when you wake up early you have more time to focus on things like self-care and reading that you will often not focus on if you are rushing out of the door every single morning.</p><p>Start small and build up.</p><h1>2. Make Your Bed</h1><p>The reason making your bed is so powerful is that it allows you to successfully complete a task first thing in the morning, which then builds momentum to continue doing more for the rest of the day.</p><p>Making my bed has taught me that how you do anything will be how you do everything. No matter how bad or stressful your day becomes, you can always make your bed. And if that is all that you complete in the day; it is still a success.</p><p>Growing up I hated making my bed, now I relish it. In fact, I sometimes get upset when my fianc\u00e9 makes it before I have a chance to do it.</p><h1>3. Meditate / Pray</h1><p>Like some of you, I used to be very skeptical of meditation. Just the word itself has an aura of incense and ommming. I didn\u2019t want to lose my edge or be one of those hippies sitting cross-legged playing the banjo and singing Kumbaya. But as I dug deeper into the research, I found that mindfulness meditation (devoid of religious ties) can have massive, positive effects on your brain and help decrease your anxiety and depression, substantially.</p><p>According to an article written by the Harvard Medical School, \u201cMindfulness meditation can help ease psychological stresses like anxiety, depression, and pain.\u201d</p><p>Well\u2026if Harvard said it worked, I better try it. So, I gave it a shot using the free 10-day trial from Headspace. And the results have been amazing. I started to feel calmer and had more clarity in my thoughts and emotions after five days. However, It took me several months to make this a recurring habit, but now that it is a staple in my morning routine, the benefits have been less anxiety, more clarity in business decisions, and overall increased happiness.</p><p>I have furthered my exploration into mindfulness and meditation and it has brought so much more depth and healing into my life. By being present to the moment you start to wake up to how much chatter you have going on in your head on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>The goal is not to stop these thoughts but rather to be aware of them and act on them skillfully. When you can do that it changes your life.</p><p>Best Resources on Getting Started:</p><p>Headspace</p><p>Waking Up By Sam Harris</p><h1>4. Take a Cold Shower</h1><p>Disclaimer: This sounds awful. In fact, when I first heard about it I didn\u2019t try it for months because I didn\u2019t think it could help and I loathed the idea of taking a freezing, cold shower. However, after 3-months of consistently taking a cold shower every morning, I can ensure you the benefits are enormous.</p><p>The science behind cold exposure is not new science. Cold shower therapy is an ancient Ayurvedic remedy that has numerous health benefits such as treating anxiety and depression, improving circulation and toning skin. The use of coldness as a \u2018good stressor\u2019 on the body can help to trigger several helpful responses within the human body. It allows the controlled elicitation of the body\u2019s natural cell repairing, pain & inflammation-reducing and metabolic processes.</p><p>A study by Researcher Nikolai Shevchuk of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine found that cold showers can alleviate, and even prevent depression and anxiety. Shevchuk makes the claim that short, cold showers may stimulate the locus ceruleous, or \u201cblue spot,\u201d which is the brain\u2019s primary source of noradrenaline \u2014 a biochemical that could help mediate depression and anxiety. The body is stressed by a hostile factor \u2014 in this case, icy water \u2014 that stimulates a healing response in the body and can lead to lower levels of anxiety and depression as well as a plethora of other benefits.</p><p>The easiest recipe to get the psychological lift is by taking a cold shower for 2 to 3 minutes once or twice daily, preceded by a five-minute gradual adaptation to the temperature (i.e. start your shower hot and then finish it with 2\u20133 minutes of pure icy goodness). Only taking a cold shower can strengthen your body\u2019s parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, increase proper circulation of blood through your body, and contract your muscles to eliminate toxins and poisonous wastes.</p><p>Cold Therapy Experts:</p><p>Dr. Ronda Patrick</p><p>I wrote a full post on the benefits of cold showers. Check it out here.</p><h1>5. Go For a Walk</h1><p>Until recently, my mornings would always start with a cup of coffee. I have been consuming the beverage ever since I can remember, and I never wanted to lose that, but there came a point where I knew that healing my anxiety was much more important than the benefits of coffee. So I went cold turkey.</p><p>However, I needed to replace this habit with another, more helpful one. I decided that an early morning thirty-minute walk would be an amazing way to start the day. Not only does it get me out of the house and allow me to enjoy nature, it also helps increase blood flow and mood.</p><p>Some of the most famous men and women have been known to be huge meanderers (I think I made that up, but that\u2019s okay). I have been extremely pleased with this new update to my routine.</p><p>Give it a try, but leave your phone at home. Just embrace your surrounds and be grateful that you woke up this morning.</p><h1>6. Brain Dump at Desk</h1><p>\u201cCould bitching and moaning on paper for 5 minutes each day change your life? As crazy as it may seem, I believe the answer is yes.\u201d -Tim Ferriss</p><p>Are they all crazy? How am I supposed to find the time to write out my thoughts every morning? I am not a writer. How could writing down my anxious ruminations help me overcome anxiety?</p><p>That was my initial barrage of fears when I first heard about the power of journaling. And if you are not someone who is already journaling for growth, your reaction is going to be the same.</p><p>But I am happy to say that I was dead wrong</p><p>Over the past 12-months, journaling has been one of the four cornerstone habits (the other being meditation, exercise, and healthy</p><p>diet) that I have implemented in my daily routine that has changed my life.</p><p>For me, the purpose of journaling is to create a vessel for clarity and resilience. A mode of transportation that takes my thoughts from anxious ruminations to empowered actions. It is an amazing way to trap your thoughts on paper and give you a heightened view of your internal dialogue; not a hack that will generate wealth and success simply by writing about it.</p><p>Some of the ways it has changed my life:</p><ul><li>I\u2019ve massively reduced my daily anxiety and overwhelm</li><li>I\u2019ve figured out the main triggers for my anxious thoughts</li><li>I\u2019ve worked through massive life-changing decisions (getting married, leaving a job, starting a business, etc.)</li><li>I\u2019ve discovered trends in my thinking that has lead to critical insights into my business and life</li><li>It has unhinged a lot of the anchors in my mind and has opened a space for more creativity and growth</li><li>It has helped me to leave situations and people that were not building me up</li><li>Journaling is one of those things that sounds so simple that you initially believe that it will not work for you.</li><li>But what I have learned from the greatest teachers is that it is often the simplest things that have the biggest impact on your life.</li></ul><p>The Two Main Reasons I Journal:</p><p>1.

Gratitude Practice</h1><p>I write the three things I am most grateful for today:</p><p>The key here is not to repeat that you are grateful for your family, life, and god. The key is to focus on being aware of the smaller things in life that you would miss if you were gone. This is a very powerful practice that has been utilized by the Stoics, Billionaires, and monks to help them appreciate life and reduce anxiety. Dr. Emmons, a gratitude researcher, confirms that practicing gratitude daily can reduce anxiety and depression.</p><p>The three \u201ctopics\u201d I find easiest to channel are:</p><p>1. Person \u2014 I write one thing about my fianc\u00e9 that I am grateful for every morning. But it could be anyone for you and probably helps if you change it every day to realize how many people you are grateful for.</p><p>2. Small object close by \u2014 The wind blowing on your face, the warmth of the coffee mug, the silence of your bedroom. This is a stoic practice to realize that even if everything you owned was taken from you there are still small pleasures in life.</p><p>3. Something I would miss if it were gone \u2014 running water, heat, the ability to run, etc.</p><h1>8. Manifest Your Morning Three</h1><p>1. Affirmation: By stating three affirmations in the morning I am able to put myself into a charged state. It may seem hokey, but it has been hugely beneficial to my mental state.</p><p>2. What do I get to enjoy today \u2014 By starting my day thinking about what I get to enjoy today, I put my mind into a positive mode and trigger my brain to see the upside of the day.</p><p>3. Daily Intention \u2014 I start out each day with intention. Whether it\u2019s as simple as \u201cI will be present today\u201d or \u201cI will choose to see the beauty in everything that happens to me today.\u201d It doesn\u2019t really matter, but I have found it extremely helpful for lowering my daily anxiety to be intentional about what I want my day\u2019s purpose to be,</p><h1>9. MITs: Three Most Important Tasks that need to get done</h1><p>Even a basic plan of attack for your day can drastically reduce your anxiety by decreasing the cognitive load that comes with increased decision making. Each morning we wake up with a finite amount of brainpower and every decision we make detracts from it. By having a basic structure that decreases the number of decisions you have to make about what you are going to do next, you will be able to take control of your day and calm your restless mind.\u201d</p><p>Every morning, I write down the 3\u20135 things that are making me the most anxious or stressed out. They tend to be things that I have pushed off for days on end. And more often than not, they are the most difficult or uncomfortable tasks that I need to do in order to move forward.</p><p>Once I have written out the 3\u20135 MOST important tasks \u2014 and no more \u2014 I ask myself the following questions to help me prioritize which to focus on first:</p><p>1. What task, if completed successfully, will make all of the others obsolete?</p><p>2. What task do I have the most anxiety/fear about?</p><p>3. What task will move me closest to accomplishing my number 1 goal?</p><h1>10. 60 \u2014 90 Minutes of Deep Work on #1 MIT prior to email</h1><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s your job to eat a frog, it\u2019s best to do it first thing in the morning. And If it\u2019s your job to eat two frogs, it\u2019s best to eat the biggest one first.\u201d \u2014 Mark Twain</p><p>Once I have prioritized my top MIT for the day, I block off 90 minutes of time to focus exclusively on it. This is a common strategy known as the 90\u201390\u20131 rule.</p><p>Why is it so important to get the top MIT done first thing in the morning?</p><p>Well, according to psychologist Ron Friedman, the first three hours of your day are your most precious for maximized productivity. \u201cTypically, we have a window of about three hours where we\u2019re focused. We\u2019re able to have some strong contributions regarding planning, regarding thinking, regarding speaking well,\u201d Friedman told Harvard Business Review.</p><p>I understand we all have different schedules and responsibilities, but if we want to overcome anxiety and move our goals forward truly we must protect our mornings. If we don\u2019t take control of our mornings, something else will.</p><p>Don\u2019t check your email or social media until you have spent at least 30\u201390 minutes of uninterrupted time on your number 1 MIT. Use your mornings for output, not more meaningless input. As productivity expert Benjamin Hardy says, \u201c[p]rotecting your mornings means you are unreachable during certain hours. Only in the case of serious emergency can you be summoned from your focus-cave.\u201d</p><p>Not only will this help you complete your number 1 MIT, but it will also do wonders for your anxiety throughout the day.</p><h1>Make It Sustainable</h1><p>The purpose of this list is to be a roadmap, a blueprint, to help you reduce your anxiety by creating an empowering morning routine. It is packed with strategies and loads of scientific research about what routines and habits are the most effective to lower your anxiety and increase your life. But the most important strategy of all is to remember that when you are creating your own confident morning it needs to be sustainable for you. The best routine is the one you actually stick to.</p><p>If you are anything like I used to be, you need to listen to this part. I used to spend so much time worrying about the \u201cperfect\u201d morning routine. Should I wake up at 5:45 or 6:00. Should I meditate before or after, I shower? Should I exercise or not exercise? This constant need to be perfect kept my mornings stressful and prevented me from forming habits with my morning.</p><p>So, my hope is that you try out some of the ones that worked wonders for decreasing my anxiety and test if they make a difference for you. If they don\u2019t then drop them and try something else. The key is to keep testing what works and what doesn\u2019t for you and your life. The more you test; the closer you will get to your confident morning.</p><p>An Empowered Morning isn\u2019t something that just falls into your lap \u2014 it\u2019s created consciously.

Here\u2019s What Happened.</h1><a></a><a>Bjorgvin Benediktsson</a><a>May 19, 2017</a><p>Instant Workaholism Is No Substitute for Happy Hour.</p><p>From April 10th to May 10th I stopped drinking entirely. I wrote the bulk of this article the day I could start drinking, but in the interest of experimentation I decided to wait to publish it.</p><p>You know, just in case something went terribly wrong and I ruined my life by going back to beer. Turns out, I\u2019m still here.</p><p>The day I could start drinking again was an interesting one. Because I enjoy a nice, cold craft beer so much I would\u2019ve thought that I\u2019d be giddy with excitement, like a toddler waking up on Christmas day.</p><p>Alas, I felt more indifferent about it than I thought I would.</p><p>But let\u2019s start at the beginning.</p><h1>Why I Decided to Quit Drinking</h1><p>The biggest reason I decided to do my 30-day challenge was a simple one:</p><p>I wanted to know if I could do it.</p><p>As someone who regularly has a beer at lunch, likes to celebrate a workday with a couple of drinks at the bar and parties on the weekends I wanted to know just how strong of a hold alcohol had on my life.</p><p>It turns out, my \u201calcoholism\u201d has nothing on my willpower.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t classify the challenge as \u201ceasy, \u201d but it was far from difficult. There was never a time I was so desperate to finish the challenge that I banished alcohol from the house or didn\u2019t meet people at happy hour because it was at a bar.</p><p>To demonstrate, this was the cooler sitting in my shed the entire duration of this challenge.</p><p>Curiosity was the biggest reason for trying the challenge. I wanted to see what, if anything, would happen if I completely gave up alcohol for a month.</p><h2>30 days later, I\u2019ve had my most productive and financially successful month of my career.</h2><p>However, I can\u2019t say the two things are 100% positively correlated, but it does have an interesting twist to it.</p><p>One tends to substitute addictions instead of getting rid of them. In my case, workaholism took over. Since I wasn\u2019t socializing and having a beer to calm me down and zone me out, there was no reason NOT to work from 5\u201310 PM.</p><p>An extra 3\u20135 hours of work every day wasn\u2019t bad per say, but it wasn\u2019t positive either. As All-Father \u00d3\u00f0inn (yes, I\u2019m Icelandic. Yes, I\u2019m quoting Norse Gods) says, and I\u2019m paraphrasing,</p><p>\u201cEverything is great in moderation.\u201d</p><p>Moderation and balance are the keys to being a successful, well-rounded person. Therefore, isolated workaholism isn\u2019t the solution for filling the time you used to use for happy hour.</p><p>Even though I was more productive, it didn\u2019t necessarily contribute to my overall well-being. I was just being productive for productivity\u2019s sake instead of using that time for personal development in other ways. My financial success that month had more to do with a product creation that happened before my challenge started than my sobriety. However, the launch of that product happened during my 30-day challenge so I can\u2019t rule out a certain level of clear-headedness that might have added to its success.</p><p>Here are some further thoughts I had during and after my experiment.</p><h2>You Have Way More Energy</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, hangovers zap your energy like Anna \u201cRogue\u201d Marie zaps your mutant powers. If you drink too much (especially after you turn 30), you\u2019re grumpy and unproductive for most of the day after. The morning benefits of sobriety are great. Your sleep quality is better, you wake up clear-headed, and your workday is more exciting.</p><p>Of course, I work for myself and get to decide what I do every day, so I\u2019m pretty lucky in that regard. If you hate your job, maybe it\u2019s better to just do it in a zombie state. However, if happy hour is the only thing you look forward to during your workday maybe the problem isn\u2019t your drinking, but rather your career choice?</p><p>Without a hangover, my morning routine is way more enjoyable. You can read all about it here, but needless to say, it\u2019s easier to get a good head-start on the morning when you want to get out of bed.</p><h2>Calmness</h2><p>I felt calmer and in touch with my emotions when I was completely sober. Also, because I was never hungover, it was easier to stick to my meditation routine.</p><p>Meditation teaches you to respond instead of react to external issues. As I was completely sober and meditating more than usual, I was calmer and more aware of every situation that needed my response. Instead of knee-jerk reactions of annoyance, I would be more methodical in my answers.</p><h2>Bars are Boring</h2><p>If you don\u2019t drink, you don\u2019t want to hang out at bars, but you still don\u2019t want to change your entire routine and alienate all your friends.</p><p>This was a difficult one because bars lose their appeal when you don\u2019t want 99% of what they have on the menu. They also get old fast once the crowd starts getting drunk and loud.</p><p>However, your friends are the reason you\u2019re at the bar in the first place, not the alcohol. That said, you still feel awkward because of the unwritten social contract of having a drink in front of you.</p><p>Solution?</p><p>Order a non-alcoholic cocktail. Some bartenders in Tucson took their non-alcoholic cocktail making skills seriously, and I thank them for it.</p><p>Cameron over at Congress even told me,</p><p>\u201cJust tell everybody it\u2019s a Tom Collins if you\u2019re asked.\u201d</p><p>People tend to act weird if you say you\u2019re not drinking but they won\u2019t question you if you tell them a name of an alcoholic drink.</p><p>The main point here is that you shouldn\u2019t stop your routine just because you don\u2019t drink. You will feel self-conscious and weird about not having a drink in your hands. It\u2019s a psychological thing so make sure you have something to do with your hands.</p><p>During this challenge, I realized that I also just drink too fast in general, regardless of the drink\u2019s alcohol content. I thought I drank quickly because I wanted to get drunk faster but turns out I drink a glass of soda water just as fast.</p><p>I attribute this to my hyperactive, Type-A disorder of wanting to fill every pause in the conversation with a sip of what I\u2019m drinking, instead of some underlying, alcoholic speed demon.</p><h2>You\u2019re Very Alert</h2><p>It\u2019s a funny feeling to be sober when everybody else around you is trashed. People stop paying attention to their surroundings as they get drunker. They block off the world except for what\u2019s going on around their 3-feet radius. This makes people watching hilarious because everybody seems oblivious to the fact that they are in a room filled with a bunch of other people.</p><p>So unless you stare intently at somebody and get their attention, it\u2019s easy to turn your boring night out into an anthropological observation.</p><h2>People Seem Into the \u201cIdea,\u201d not the \u201cExecution.\u201d</h2><p>When I mentioned my challenge to people, they seemed supportive and interested. They said things like \u201cit\u2019s good to do that\u201d or \u201cI should try that sometime\u201d but what I heard was,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool and all, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing that.\u201d</p><p>There was always that underlying tone in their voice that suggested that yes, maybe in a perfect world that would be interesting, but there\u2019s no way they\u2019re making that a priority. I don\u2019t blame them. After doing the challenge, I learned that I\u2019m not interested in being 100% sober all the time either.</p><h2>Nobody Notices You\u2019re Not Drinking</h2><p>People are self-absorbed most of the time, especially when they\u2019ve been drinking. I don\u2019t mean that in a mean way. It\u2019s simply a very honest observation. Everybody\u2019s looking out for themselves and they should. It\u2019s a natural extension of their survival instinct.</p><p>Because of this, people don\u2019t notice you\u2019re not drinking unless you tell them.</p><p>My friends are used to me drinking all the time. They don\u2019t even have a reason to question what I have in my cup, so they get very surprised when I tell them I haven\u2019t been drinking at all. Not then, nor at the party yesterday where we hung out together too.</p><h2>You save SO much money.</h2><p>I probably go out about 4\u20135 times per week.</p><p>That includes happy hour, weekend outings and brunch. If you also count buying alcohol from the grocery store, it starts to build up.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume I go to dinner two times per week and I have two drinks at dinner. That\u2019s about $12\u201315 on average each time (only counting drinks). I would go to happy hour about three times on average, usually drinking about three beers over the course of the night. That would end up being ~$20 each time with tax and tip.</p><p>For brunch, we\u2019re pretty good at finding good bottomless mimosas or cheap drinks. However, that\u2019s still about $10\u201315 each Sunday.</p><p>Then, if I buy one nice 12 pack of beer at the grocery store, I\u2019d be spending around $20 on that.</p><p>This is an estimate, and it\u2019s probably conservative, to be honest. But it comes out to $125 per week or $6,500 per year. That\u2019s a pretty good chunk of money and well past 10% of the average household income. Realizing you\u2019re spending that much on alcohol hurts in more ways than one.</p><h2>You\u2019re Healthier</h2><p>Just like it\u2019s easier to be productive when you\u2019re not hungover, it\u2019s easier to persuade yourself to work out. Although I don\u2019t need much persuasion to exercise in general, whether I\u2019m drinking or not, I went to the gym more often.</p><p>Instead of 2\u20133 times per week I would now be going 3\u20135 times instead. 30 days might not be enough time to gauge any measurable body results, but I feel fitter and healthier. And without the additional carb load from 3\u20136 beers every day I don\u2019t feel as fat. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve lost any weight, but I do feel stronger. I can probably thank my strength training for transforming my fat to muscle in that case.</p><p>In addition to working out more, I also cook better dinners. Instead of having a couple of drinks at happy hour and then being too lazy to cook I spend more time in the kitchen and eat healthier food.</p><h2>Results and Thoughts</h2><p>Overall, it was an interesting challenge. Now I know I can easily do it and can stop worrying about whether I\u2019m slowly succumbing to some demon disease I don\u2019t have.</p><p>The hardest parts of the challenge were the happy hour times between 5 and 7 pm. There\u2019s just something so rewarding about a job-well-done drink that it was hard to give that up.</p><p>Weirdly enough, the desire for a drink dissipated fairly quickly after dinnertime because at that point I had no desire to drink because of the possibility of being hungover in the morning. That\u2019s why the 5\u20137 pm time frame is such a sweet spot. You can relax and enjoy a cold drink without any huge professional consequences.</p><p>The biggest change was my increased workaholism. I realized that I work too much. The challenge made me more productive, but it didn\u2019t necessarily make my life any better.</p><p>Although I did have one of my best months as an entrepreneur, was it ALL the consequence of not drinking? No, but being clear headed every morning and working most weekends helped.</p><p>Overall, I learned a lot about willpower, productivity and substituting habits. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out for sobriety because I like my happy hour too much. But it made me realize that waking up early and being productive makes me happy as well.</p><p>In my case, balancing the two, in moderation, seems like a good barometer for success.</p><p>Or as \u00d3\u00f0inn would say,</p><p>\u201cDrink your mead, but in moderation, Talk sense or be silent:No man is called discourteous who goes To bed at an early hour\u201d</p><h2>I help creatives build their online presence and teach them how to promote themselves online so they can reach more fans and increase their income doing what they love.

That tell-tale tickle in your throat, the drippy nose that starts a cascade of sneezes, that sinking feeling when you realize, \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m sick!\u201d This early stage of cold and flu symptoms is no time to wait and see how bad it will get. If you treat your symptoms early enough, you may be able to prevent the virus from spreading to others or becoming worse. The first 24 hours are critical.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I recommend to my patients at the first sign of symptoms such as fever, headache, cough, congestion, sore throat, body aches and chills, and/or exhaustion.</p><h2>Tips for Early Treatment:</h2><ol><li>Don\u2019t Over-Exert Yourself. When you\u2019re starting to feel sick, this is not the time to run a few miles or pull an all-nighter for a big project. It\u2019s your chance to rest, recuperate, and let your body recover. Pushing your limits at this point will take away important energy your body needs to get better \u2014 and potentially increase the time it takes to get well.</li><li>Over the Counter Medicines Can Help. Early symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, and sinus pain can be treated with pain-relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Be sure to read the label carefully and follow dosage recommendations exactly. Taking too little medication may not be effective \u2014 taking too much can be dangerous. Remember, doses for children vary based on their age and weight, and children under the age of 18 should not be given aspirin. It can cause a serious condition called Reye\u2019s Syndrome.</li><li>Avoid Cold and Damp Environments. Although it\u2019s a myth that you\u2019ll get sick just from not bundling up when it\u2019s cold outside, it\u2019s true that bacteria and viruses thrive at cooler temperatures. So if you\u2019re fighting a bug, it\u2019s best to stay warm and dry.</li><li>Get Enough Sleep. In the first 24 hours of an illness, you should sleep as much as possible to give your body a chance to recover. Resist the urge to binge watch your favorite shows or stay up late catching up on emails. Go to bed!</li><li>Drink Plenty of Fluids. Staying hydrated is one of the best things you can do for your body while your immune system is gearing up for a fight. Water, decaffeinated tea, sport drinks, and sugar-free drinks are best. They can help fight dehydration associated with fever. Also, hot tea with lemon and honey can soothe congestion, sore throat, and cough.</li></ol><h2>When it Lasts Longer Than 24 Hours:</h2><p>If you don\u2019t improve after 24 hours, you may want to consult a doctor. Multiple conditions (eg, flu, strep throat, bronchitis) share similar symptoms. But while your fever, cough, and sore throat may feel the same, each condition calls for a different treatment, and telling them apart can be confusing.</p><p>When it comes to the flu, starting antiviral medicine within the first 48 hours can lead to a shorter and milder illness \u2014 so it\u2019s important to act fast. Doctor On Demand lets you avoid the wait and see a doctor immediately by video, right from your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Early treatment can get you feeling better faster and avoid spreading the virus to others.</p><p>Dr. Amy Cottrell is board-certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and is an active member of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

You are preparing an elegant dinner for yourself and your significant other. You head into a liquor store looking for the perfect alcoholic beverage to complement the flavors of your meal. Do you walk up to the counter and ask the shopkeeper for the bottle with the highest alcohol percentage? Most likely not, as Everclear doesn\u2019t really have the most appetizing taste.</p><p>But with the advent of state legal marijuana, many dispensaries in the United States report that medical patients or recreational users tend to do just that when selecting their strains. \u201cWhich one has the highest THC content,\u201d is a question often heard by the ears of budtenders, suggesting that anything with a lower count isn\u2019t worth their dollar. But that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. After all, what is the reason that sometimes one drinks a beer, another time one enjoys a glass of wine, and yet another night one savors a smooth whiskey on the rocks?</p><p>The problem with selecting cannabis strains based solely on the THC content is much like stomaching the worst swill at the bar just because it has a high alcoholic percentage. By doing this, the consumer is robbing themselves of not only the rich scents and flavors of the strain, but also missing out on the beneficial effects that can be delivered through a strain\u2019s specific terpene profile.</p><p>Terpenes are essential oils that determine all of these factors and make each strain unique. Together with the cannabinoid content \u2014 compounds such THC or CBD \u2014 we get what\u2019s often referred to as an \u201centourage effect,\u201d which ultimately has the final say in what kind of benefits you can receive from a particular strain. In fact, it has almost gotten to the point where one can zero in on what exactly they would like a strain to do for them, and by studying the effects of the individual terpenes, with a little trial-and-error, they can find the perfect strain to suit their needs.</p><p>But because of the limited scientific research done inside the United States on marijuana, many of these discoveries have been made \u201cin the field\u201d by the underground cannabis users.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the rest of the scientific community is in the present, but as far as marijuana is concerned, we are sitting at the forefront of the scientific revolution,\u201d says Adam Laikin, Director of Marketing for Tryke companies.</p><p>Darin Carpenter, Director of Cultivation at Tryke, feels passionately about the science of terpenes. We spoke to him to get a better idea about the fascinating discoveries happening in this space.</p><p>Mike Pizzo: When did people really start looking at terpenes as a variable in the cultivation process for marijuana?</p><p>Darin Carpenter: I think generally people were looking at terpenes \u2014 whether they knew it or not \u2014 way back in the underground days, because terpenes are what give the cannabis its smell. Some people prefer very strong, pungent types of smells. Others prefer the sweet types of smells. Other growers didn\u2019t want any type of smell. But it was all based on the concentration and makeup of the terpenes.</p><p>More recently, I think, the terpenes became more of a major subject of interest, once states started mandating analytical labs to test the different potencies of various compounds. This caused people to start truly questioning the effects and combinations of terpenes and cannabinoids.</p><p>What are some good examples of how the entourage effect works or how cultivators zero in on what is going to work together in a strain?</p><p>It\u2019s synergy; multiple elements that work together to amplify an effect. When the cannabinoids are paired with terpenes and certain concentrations of them, that\u2019s what generally provides the particular effect. What science understands now is that the combination of those terpenes actually has the ultimate say in the type of effect and intensity that one experiences when consuming cannabis.</p><p>Cannabinoids do have a very specific effect, but the terpenes work to amplify that effect and move it to a more particular subset, whether it\u2019s anti-anxiety, paired with pain remediation, or helping people with insomnia, etc. CBD, for instance, is known to be a neural protectant. So that\u2019s the effect of it, helping people with seizures, etc. When people are consuming a CBD plant with one profile of terpenes, they might get a different effect than consuming a different CBD plant with a different terpene profile.</p><p>What are some of the more popular terpenes, or are they well known enough to be popular?</p><p>Well, for instance, myrcene gives off the sweet smell, more indicative of indica plants. Then you have limonene, which has more of a citrus odor, which leans heavier into sativas. There are over 200 terpenes out there, it\u2019s just the molecular composition that changes its odor and effect.</p><p>I think there is a lot more experimentation that needs to be done. Certain labs are actually increasing the number of terpenes and cannabinoids that they are actually looking for, in an effort to understand the entourage effect of the molecular profile of that particular genetic and how it effects individuals. You can break the terpenes down to a core group, but there might be some other compounds that actually are enhancing that core group for the total enhancement. There is a lot more work that needs to be done.</p><p>Probably because there are so many combinations out there, right?</p><p>Right. So, for instance, Medusa, some people just don\u2019t like Medusa. It doesn\u2019t work for them. But for me, it might be the thing that takes my pain away. It might be the thing that helps me with anxiety, or symptom I am trying to control. One strain might work for you, that may not work for me the same way. One may make you feel relaxed and comfortable, while I might get a feeling of paranoia.</p><p>Everyone is harping on, \u201cI have to have the highest THC concentration.\u201d To me, it\u2019s not about that. It\u2019s the effect and finding the strain that works for you, particularly. Yes, THC gives you that psychoactive effect, but some of the better strains out there aren\u2019t higher THC. It\u2019s the combination of the flavors and the terpenes that are paired with the THC and the cannabinoids that make it so powerful. People see THC as a value proposition, like \u201cI am spending $25 an eighth and this one\u2019s got 30% THC. Why would I spend $35 or $45 on something that\u2019s got 15%?\u201d If they tried it, they might see that it\u2019s not all the THC. They actually might get a better effect, taste and experience because of the terpene/cannabinoid profile that works best for them.</p><p>Federal law has made it really difficult to study cannabis in the United States, so there is not a lot of scientific research done on this here, right?</p><p>Yeah, not a lot in the United States. Israel and England is where most of the research is being done.</p><p>That actually brings up another point, that a lot of the \u201ctesting\u201d is going on in the field, where people are going \u201cThis worked for me, this didn\u2019t,\u201d etc. And through word-of-mouth, those findings are kind of going \u201cviral\u201d in the cannabis community, is that right?</p><p>Yeah. A lot of the guys in Mendocino and Santa Rosa, the Emerald Triangle area, they were kind of growing and breeding what works for them and what speaks to them. That\u2019s really kind of how it\u2019s been, but nobody that I am aware of has really started a targeted breeding program to develop strains to create a library with a wide range of particular effects, quality and yield.</p><p>So do you think people that are purchasing based only on a super high THC levels are doing so out of naivety?</p><p>It\u2019s not always about the concentration of the psychoactive ingredients in the flower. It is the combination of the terpenes and cannabinoids that provide that effect. So if people are looking for something, they don\u2019t need to go for that super high-potency strain. Yes, it may work for them, but there are other options that may or may not.</p><p>For me, I hate expensive beers. If you take some super craft, micro brew with a heavy amount of hops and for me it just tastes too bitter. It doesn\u2019t quench my thirst. I prefer other types of flavors when enjoying a beer. I think when educating the patients, we need to explain that you will still get the desired effect in most cases, and because of that, you should enjoy something that has the flavor profile smell and look that speaks to you and controls their individual symptoms.</p><p>How and where can people figure out what the effects of each terpene are and which strain is right for them?</p><p>Leafly and Weedmaps have that capability. They have a menu where you can search for strains that provide whatever you are looking for and where to get them.</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, please click the \u2665 icon below.

The carb coma. The falling off the wagon. And the feeling of failure once again.</p><p>This is how most of the weight loss industry works.</p><p>Dirty keto is no exception.</p><p>The weight loss industry is rigged to keep you on the yo-yo routine so that you\u2019re constantly buying more \u2018stuff\u2019 and feeling like you\u2019re not good enough.</p><p>You might get a quick win, but the weight always comes back, because you have not been taught the skills to keep it going on your own.</p><p>Have you ever thought \u201cI\u2019m not good enough?\u201d</p><p>Have you ever worried that there will never be an \u201cafter\u201d photo?</p><p>That someone having a body you are proud of is not in cards for you?</p><p>I work from a different vantage point.</p><p>I always start with the premise that your body WANTS to be healthy, no matter what label you have been given.</p><p>Essentially, dirty keto, is what is commonly available in the market right now.</p><p>It is when people will eliminate all carbs from their diet, including vegetables, and then proceed to eat equally nutritiously devoid toxic garbage.</p><p>I may be breaking some hearts here, but you can\u2019t just eat bacon, lard, and greasy burgers forever.</p><p>Dirty keto is a substitution of one bad habit for another.</p><p>Sure, getting rid of processed carbohydrates is awesome, but substituting it ONLY for bacon, butter and burgers is not.</p><p>Reducing your carbohydrate load has a direct impact on mortality \u2026 but are you really going to eat bacon fat fudge as a snack forever?</p><p>What are we, 6 years old with no executive brain function? How is this a reasonable long term solution, or considered healthy by any means??</p><p>Like I said\u2026play the long game. Bacon fudge, butter, and lard all day err day is not taking into consideration longevity or vitality.</p><p>Yes macros are important, but so are micronutrients \u2014 the minerals and vitamins derived from plants and other living things.</p><p>On a cellular level, eating a properly formulated, clean ketogenic diet will support enhanced mitochondrial function, reduce ROS that cause oxidative damage, prevent cellular senescence, and increase the production of butyrate, B-hydroxybutyrate.</p><p>It amplifies autophagy, prevents cellular aging and precancerous pathways like mTOR.</p><p>Now, if you are a meat eater, I\u2019m not saying you can never eat bacon.</p><p>Of course you can.</p><p>And I\u2019m not AGAINST bacon and butter \u2014 I love them both.</p><p>But I am always going to look at things from both a practical perspective, and from a longevity and vitality lens.</p><p>Bacon all day every day (which is what a lot of keto \u201cexperts\u201d will recommend) is not a long term solution for optimal health and vitality.</p><p>A properly formulated ketogenic diet is primarily plant based.</p><p>Meaning we are eating a large amount of vegetables (like green leafy ones with a high fiber content), and then layering appropriate fat and protein on top of that.</p><p>What\u2019s nice about a \u201cclean\u201d ketogenic diet is that vegetarians can also be successful in becoming fat-adapted, and also profit from the benefits from a fasting-mimicking diet.</p><p>When you layer fasting along with a fasting-mimicking diet \u2014 you\u2019ve hit the jackpot.</p><p>When we think about playing the long game with your health, we should always be asking the following questions:</p><p>What are the things I can eat that are anti \u2014 inflammatory?</p><p>What are foods I can create that will nourish and feed my cells?</p><p>What will help with regular and consistent elimination?</p><p>What will make me feel good and stabilize my mood, increase my energy, focus, and clarity?</p><p>How can I keep my brain happy and healthy?</p><p>The answer my friends, are your vegetables and your fats. Just like mom used to tell you.</p><p>I realize, as someone who spends most of her time educating people about brain health and optimization, that the brain is often forgotten.</p><p>We cannot see the brain, and changes in function are often not noticed because they are so subtle, and because the way the brain is is the way we are.</p><p>It is immensely difficult to detect changes unless they are severe.</p><p>It is hard to detect changes in your brain, because you ARE your brain.</p><p>We need to be thinking about the brain, and optimizing the brain\u2019s performance, because your body, in all its glory, is simply a reflection of brain health and function.</p><p>One of the ways in which you can protect your brain is by the fuel you feed your brain in order to perform its best.</p><p>Everything follows the brain.</p><p>In fact, when we look at your body ,all parameters of your body \u2014 HRV, blood pressure, respiratory rate, forced vital capacity, grip strength, hormones, lab markers \u2014 will give you a good picture of the health and vitality of your brain, too.</p><p>Hormones out of whack? We need to look at the brain.</p><p>Overweight? We need to look at the brain</p><p>Low energy? We need to look at the brain</p><p>Cannot sleep through the night? We need to look at the brain.</p><p>Poor focus? We need to look at the brain.</p><p>Mood swings? We need to look at the brain.</p><p>We need to stop looking at the end organ as the primary focus, and instead look a level or two up to find why downstream changes are happening at the organ or behavioural level.</p><p>So, when we are talking about the best fuel you need to feed your brain (and therefore your body), we need to be thinking about the best possible foods for lowering inflammation, improving autophagy, removing cellular senescence, enhance energy production with whole, nutrient dense foods.</p><p>Because all these things help your brain.</p><p>We need to be thinking about a clean ketogenic diet.</p><p>Not dirty keto.</p><p>Not bacon, burgers, and butter.</p><p>Just because it fits the macros, doesn\u2019t mean you should do it.</p><h1>1. Too Much Protein Makes You Age *AND* Gain Weight</h1><p>\u201cGo vegetable heavy. Reverse the psychology of your plate by making meat the side dish and vegetables the main course.\u201d \u2014 Bobby Flay</p><p>The big pattern I have found most often with people doing dirty keto engage in, is unknowingly they consume too much protein.</p><p>Day over day, week over week, a dirty keto diet will predictably lead to an increase in protein consumption.</p><p>This is because eating protein, if you are not feeding your microbiome, can feel more \u201csatisfying\u201d than fat, and with time, you want to eat it more and more.</p><p>Excess protein consumption is insulinergic, just as carbohydrates are.</p><p>Meaning, consuming protein will raise insulin in the same manner carbohydrates do. The excess protein will be converted into glucose, thereby raising insulin levels, and fat storage.</p><p>The insulin will try to scurry the glucose into the liver, muscles, and fat cells.</p><p>Protein also has the double edge sword of also activating mTOR \u2014 a pathway that is involved in aging, cancer, and brain cell dysregulation.</p><p>I have written about how protein may actually be making you fat here, and discuss the mTOR pathway in greater detail.</p><p>Again, with my longevity glasses on, excess protein consumption is also related to creating more cancer cells.</p><p>This is from chronic mTOR activation which leads to increased cell proliferation, cell division, and it inhibits autophagy.</p><p>Autophagy is the cleanup process that gets rid of the mutated, damaged bits of cellular debris that results from natural metabolism.</p><p>The only two populations that can and should benefit from mTOR activation are children and pregnant women \u2014 as they require cell proliferation in order to grow.</p><p>A properly formulated ketogenic diet should be plant-based. Meaning, that the majority of your plate should be green leafy vegetables.</p><p>All carbohydrates are not created equal. Green leafy veg like kale, spinach, swiss chard, bok choy, broccoli, and fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi all have an extraordinary amount of insoluble fiber.</p><p>Along with the phytonutrients derived from these vegetables, the fiber plays an important role in becoming fat-adapted, or ketogenic.</p><p>Insoluble fiber means that it cannot be broken down by the gut bacteria, and does not dissolve in water.</p><p>It is indigestible, an \u201canti-nutrient\u201d if you will, because it does not break down and become part of you.</p><p>It passes through you, cleaning up the debris, sopping up excess hormones, and cleaning out the gut track like a pipe cleaner.</p><p>Fiber is also great at retaining a lot of water, thereby making stool bulky and softer.</p><p>Consuming fiber does not affect blood sugar levels and therefore will have a negligible effect on insulin.</p><p>Congratulations, you are about halfway through my geeky magic carpet ride.

Resistant Starches, Butyrate, and Your Gut, Oh My!</h1><p>\u201cThere are receptors to these molecules in your immune system, in your gut and in your heart. So when you say, \u2018I have a gut feeling\u2019 or \u2018my heart is sad\u2019 or \u2018I am bursting with joy,\u2019 you\u2019re not speaking metaphorically. You\u2019re speaking literally.\u201d Deepak Chopra</p><p>Often forgotten is looking at the relationship between your gut and your brain.</p><p>When you are on a dirty keto program, one of the most common complaints is by week 2 or 3 you are starving. More correctly, it is your microbiome that is starving.</p><p>Part of the way we blunt this hunger response is via resistant starches. In other words, starches that \u201cresist\u201d digestion. These are abundantly found in oats, green banana flour, legumes, and beans.</p><p>On a traditional ketogenic diet, with a standard Fat:Protein:Carb ratio of 70\u201320\u201310, what I have often found is you are absolutely starving by about week 3 and will overeat and binge on protein, and carbs.</p><p>This is why most people \u201cfail\u201d at keto.</p><p>However, when we integrate fiber and resistant starches into the picture, this hunger response is blunted.</p><p>Look at this experiment on consuming resistant starches and the blunting effect on post prandial blood glucose levels.</p><p>In this graph, they are looking at the effects of taking resistant starches, followed by a high glycemic food. When taking resistant starches, the effect on blood glucose levels are outstanding compared to the baseline \u2014 a 28 point rise compared to almost 170.</p><p>When in a state of ketosis (either through a fasted state or via a fasting mimicking diet like keto), consuming resistant starches does not disturb this state:</p><p>Resistant starches are great for a ketogenic diet \u2014 they blunt your hunger response, and also blunt elevated blood glucose levels when carbohydrates are consumed.</p><p>Part of why resistant starches are so great is instead of being digested, they are selectively feeding the \u201cgood\u201d microbiota in our gut.</p><p>As these microbiota chow down on the resistant starches, they will produce short-chain fatty acids as a by-product of their meal. Of particular importance here is the short-chain fatty acid known as butyrate.</p><p>Butyrate has a whole host of beneficial effects.</p><p>One important one is decreasing gut permeability.</p><p>When the lining of the gut is more permeable, we are more susceptible to developing food allergies, food intolerances, and an overall immune system on high alert all the time.</p><p>Having an increased permeability of the gut has been associated with almost all proinflammatory conditions, including most autoimmune conditions, fatty liver, and heart disease.</p><p>Inflammation is the linchpin of most lifestyle diseases.</p><p>One of the primary objectives we must look at in any health protocol is to heal the gut.</p><p>The obvious reason here is it makes digesting food a more pleasant and efficient experience. We all want to be able to eat without gas, bloating, indigestion, or diarrhea.</p><p>But it is the knock-on positive benefits to our neurology that is of particular long term importance.</p><p>The gut has its own nervous system \u2014 the enteric nervous system \u2014 which has strong communication pathways with the brain and central nervous system.</p><p>A little nerding out for my neuronerds: Developmentally, the enteric nervous system is made from neural crest cells. Specifically the vagal neural crest cells\u2026which is why we have such strong gut reactions to stimuli. A \u201cgut feeling\u201d is the communication between the central and enteric nervous systems via the vagus nerve.</p><p>Ever feel nervous about something and then immediately have to go to the bathroom, or feel like you were going to throw up? It is because of the strong vagal tone and communication between a perceived stimulus in your brain, and the enteric nervous system in the gut.</p><p>I know. So cool, right?!</p><p>The communication between the gut and the brain is paramount, and making sure your enteric nervous system is aligned with your autonomic nervous system should be a goal in any nutrition program.</p><p>So when we feed the microbiome and they produce butyrate levels are high, you allow for gut healing to occur\u2026but it is also important in brain health.</p><p>The butyrate effect is the gift that keeps on giving.</p><p>Butyrate helps keep the brain healthy by upping the expression of neurotrophic factors.</p><p>Butyrate and the structurally similar B-hydroxybutyrate (which is produced in a ketogenic state) help increase BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), GDNF (Glial-cell derived Neurotrophic Factor) and NGF (Nerve Growth Factor).</p><p>All of these help in the maintenance of nerve cells that you already have, but also help grow new, healthy nerve cells.</p><p>In other words \u2014 butyrate, and B-hydroxybutyrate keep your brain big and juicy.</p><h1>3. Eating According To Your Menstrual Cycle For Long Term Results</h1><p>\u201cThe hormonal interplay inside a woman\u2019s head creates her reality. Her hormones tell her day to day what\u2019s important. They mold her desires and values.\u201d \u2014 Abhijit Naskar</p><p>Once you are fat-adapted by following a clean keto protocol, the best way to maintain your weight loss results is to begin to harness the power of your menstrual cycle.</p><p>Meaning, you can begin to vary the percentage of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates week by week, depending on where you are in your cycle.</p><p>You are not, as a woman, meant to be in ketosis forever.</p><p>During certain times of the month, you can and should be eating more carbohydrates, and protein.</p><p>Yes, that includes chocolate, too!</p><p>Once we have become metabolically flexible, we can use insulin, growth factors to our advantage. Insulin is not the enemy once you are fat-adapted.</p><p>When done smart, we can build lean muscle mass, continue to lose weight, suppress cravings, and support some of the moodiness that can come in the week before your period.</p><p>Serotonin gets gobbled up in the weeks leading up to your period. Trying to push through and eat low carb during this time is a recipe for failure.</p><p>Not to mention the self-talk, doubt, and inner critic that is going to go along with it.</p><p>Women are not little men.</p><p>We cannot eat the same way every day of the month or stay in ketosis forever.</p><p>I have written a week by week guide on eating in accordance with your menstrual cycle here.</p><p>Bottom line is this: Use your menstrual cycle to lose weight and keep it off over the long term.</p><h1>Want My Quickstart Guide To Using Your Menstrual Cycle To Lose Weight?</h1><p>I have created a quick start guide, including meals and nutrient breakdown for how to eat during each stage of your cycle.</p><h1>>>Click Here To Get The Guide Now<<</h1><h2>Before you go\u2026</h2><p>If you liked this article, click the\ud83d\udc4f below, and share it with others so they can enjoy it as well.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Life", "Life Lessons", "Self Improvement", "Food"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*LpUcnFkresOG4sMvsx9u8g.png"], "url": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/biohack-your-intelligence-now-or-become-obsolete-97cdd15e395f", "dateCreated": "2018-01-25T17:01:50.500Z", "datePublished": "2018-01-25T17:01:50.500Z", "dateModified": "2020-09-22T21:15:07.907Z", "headline": "How to biohack your intelligence \u2014 with everything from sex to modafinil to MDMA", "name": "How to biohack your intelligence \u2014 with everything from sex to modafinil to MDMA", "description": "I had some free time over the holidays and wrote this article to showcase, on the basis of a personal story, many highly actionable, science-based, approaches and tools that can be used to\u2026", "identifier": "97cdd15e395f", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "Serge Faguet", "url": "https://medium.com/@sergefaguet"}, "creator": ["Serge Faguet"], "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "HackerNoon.com", "url": "https://medium.com/hackernoon", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "width": 417, "height": 60, "url": "https://miro.medium.com/max/834/1*_U3cyTY4DnQ5tvS93EBhiA.png"}}, "mainEntityOfPage": "https://medium.com/hackernoon/biohack-your-intelligence-now-or-become-obsolete-97cdd15e395f"}, "content": "<h1>How to biohack your intelligence \u2014 with everything from sex to modafinil to MDMA</h1><h2>Other deep-dive articles by Serge:</h2><a></a><a>Serge Faguet</a><a>Jan 25, 2018</a><a>How I set and execute 50-year goalsIn my previous articles, I talked a lot about how to use biohacking to become more productive, healthier, and more\u2026hackernoon.com</a><a>I\u2019m 32 and spent $200k on biohacking.

It shows many health benefits \u2014 3\u20134x reduction in body fat, very high athletic performance (VO2Max ~70), negligible inflammatory processes, >80% increase in testosterone, and improvements to many biomarkers of aging.</p><p>Biohacking works.</p><p>The article became extremely popular and reached millions of readers. Many of you loved it. Many of you felt anger and fear. Aggressive bioenhancement of human abilities has long been a sci-fi dream.</p><p>And (if you read the previous article) here is concrete evidence and a lot of data that show it is already working.</p><p>I think that what we are doing with biohacking is the beginning of humanity\u2019s split into different species. Enhanced posthumans who will not look anything like the humans of today. Unenhanced humans who choose not to do this for their own reasons.</p><p>The reason this cataclysmic shift is coming: intelligence can already be enhanced.</p><h1>PART 1: INTELLIGENCE, WEALTH, AND POWER</h1><h2>So what is \u201cintelligence\u201d?</h2><p>Let\u2019s use the definition the wonderful Prof. Max Tegmark from MIT, uses in his new and highly-recommended book, Life 3.0.</p><p>\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Intelligence = ability to accomplish complex goals \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014</p><p>Intelligence is applied and multi-dimensional. Intelligence is much more than just IQ or skill at mathematics.</p><p>The above definition is critical to understanding this article \u2014 re-read it a couple times.</p><p>There are many applications of intelligence. But if we drill down, there is a set of intellectual abilities essential to nearly all complex human goals. These could be broken into:</p><ol><li>Classical Intelligence (CI): Logic, Problem Solving, Creativity, Strategy</li><li>Applied Intelligence (AI): Energy, Focus, Willpower, Emotional Control</li><li>Social Intelligence (SI): Persuasiveness, Empathy, \u201cSocial Skills\u201d</li><li>Dynamic Intelligence (DI): Ability to Learn, Memory, Knowledge</li></ol><p>\u201cIntelligence\u201d will refer to these \u201cuniversally useful intellectual abilities\u201d going forward. We can talk about those of us who have them as \u201csmart\u201d and those who do not as \u201cstupid.\u201d This will piss some of you off, but it really is time we stop pretending we are all equally smart. That sounds nice and PC, but the claim that everyone has roughly the same ability to achieve complex goals is patently false.</p><p>Intelligence:</p><ul><li>varies massively between individuals. For many reasons \u2014 IQ is 50\u201380% genetic while I would argue other types of intelligence are mostly environmental.</li><li>develops within one individual over their lifetime, and never stops changing.</li><li>fluctuates massively within one individual with biochemical changes.</li></ul><p>If the last part isn\u2019t obvious, test your ability to accomplish complex goals after not sleeping at all, while you have the flu, right after having an intense argument or after drinking 10 shots of espresso.</p><h2>So why is intelligence enhancement going to split humanity into separate species?</h2><h2>Let\u2018s start with a silly story:</h2><ul><li>Imagine there is only one way to make money in the world: running marathons. All of us are running them, every day.</li><li>Imagine further, that all the marathons of the world are rapidly uniting into one, the share of money going to winners is increasing, and the lifespan over which winners can compete is also increasing. These trends are expected to continue.</li><li>Over the last 30 years, a bunch of expensive new doping drugs and technologies appeared that are undetectable, healthy, and give a big advantage at running.</li><li>Moreover in the next 30 years a lot more such drugs will appear. They will be expensive at first. Only those of us who are already winning will be able to afford them.</li><li>We are starting to see some of us talk about how much better we run with all these drugs.</li></ul><h2>How is this relevant to enhancing our intelligence?</h2><p>The above is exactly what the world looks like today. We just need to replace \u201cmarathon running\u201d with \u201cintelligence.\u201d</p><p>Here is why:</p><ol><li>There exist a number of medical and lifestyle interventions that can significantly enhance everyday intelligence. Modafinil, SSRI microdoses, MDMA, hormone signaling, optimal sleep, mitochondria-enhancing exercise, isolation from addictive news/social media, and lots of other things.</li><li>Many of these interventions are complex, expensive, demand willpower, do not deliver easy rewards, are dangerous if done wrong. Which is why many of us could be decades late in adopting them.</li><li>Greater applied intelligence resulting from these interventions directly creates significant financial, social, physiological (health) and intellectual wealth. Life is sooooooo easy when we are always full of energy, extremely persuasive, able to focus.</li><li>This wealth can be reinvested into further enhancement of intelligence, creating an upwards spiral of wealth.</li><li>The returns on this investment loop will (a) increase with accelerating progress in biotechnology (b) provide greater comparative advantage as the world gets ever more competitive (c) compound over decades and greatly enhanced lifespans.</li></ol><p>Income is already driving biological inequality, and more of it with every year. From the stats above, we can speculate that men born in 1985 and in the top 1% of income already have a life expectancy of at least 95\u2013100; for women this number is even higher. Even before biohacking. Or the massive progress in biotechnologies anticipated in the coming decades.</p><p>To be certain of living to 100 those of us who are well-off and into basic health just need to pay attention to the data.</p><p>These trends feel unstoppable, and may even accelerate.</p><h1>PART 2: FRAMEWORK FOR BOOSTING INTELLIGENCE</h1><h2>Start with the goal</h2><p>Key point: you can\u2019t be intelligent if you don\u2019t know what you want</p><p>If we read all the tactics below without considering goals, we can be left with the impression that Serge is basically saying \u201cmine is the One True Path, everyone needs to copy me, and have sex with models in swing clubs while sipping clomid-ketone smoothies!!\u201d</p><p>I optimize my intelligence towards my specific 50-year goal. To build one of the platform companies that give us The Singularity. To help make us immortal posthuman gods that cast off the limits of our biology, and spread across the Universe. To have limitless abundance.</p><p>We don\u2019t all have the same goal. But we should accept that the above is indeed my goal, and that I find it incredibly meaningful. Much more so than wasting my life on buying yachts and jets, having children, or giving to charities.</p><p>The framework below is designed to enhance our intelligence to get us whatever we want. But you need to know precisely what that is, and I can\u2019t help you figure that out.</p><p>I want to be a god. Note the \u201ca god\u201d (as in one of many cool, ultrapowerful and ultraintelligent posthuman beings) not \u201cThe God.\u201d</p><h2>Part 1: start with Applied Intelligence</h2><p>Key point: if you can\u2019t focus, you are really, really fucking stupid</p><p>Always start with AI (energy, focus, willpower etc). This is the engine we use to power everything else.</p><p>This means:</p><ol><li>Learn to get into high-energy deep flow state every day. Key interventions: fix sleep, do intermittent fasting, get hormones to optimal levels, use modafinil, build the right habits/triggers, have high-quality deep downtime.</li><li>Ruthlessly remove everything that prevents or interrupts our flow states. Key interventions: make ourselves immune to stress (meditation, lithium, SSRIs); eliminate distractions (remove news, social media, procrastination triggers); build the right habits over time.</li></ol><p>We will dig into all these tools a bit later in the article.</p><p>Every time we successfully get into deep flow, we adapt. It becomes easier next time. Every time we procrastinate \u2014 flow becomes harder.</p><p>A sign we are smart is if we manage to get 5\u20138 hours of totally focused, truly deep, uninterrupted work with no procrastination.</p><p>And still have time and energy for gym, friends, travel, music, sports, sleep, meditation etc. \u2014 all of which we are able to be deeply engaged in.</p><p>This is feasible. In December, I managed this on 23 days, took 3 days off completely, and got disrupted down to 0\u20133 hours of deep work for 5 days for various reasons (that can be pruned further).</p><p>This level of deep work is easy to maintain, but extremely hard to get to. We are very distractible. The world is very distracting.</p><p>A clear sign we are stupid is if we do not read new books, take poor care of our health, rarely have deep conversations with friends, do not learn new skills. Because we are \u201ctoo busy.\u201d</p><p>Although at the end of the day it is hard to write down precisely what valuable progress we have achieved with our busy-ness.</p><p>In this case, we are not actually \u201cbusy.\u201d We are \u201cstupid.\u201d The good news is that we can become smarter.</p><p>This is the part when you write outraged comments about how your job/children prevent you from deep work. Suggestion: find one hour of deep work a day. Use it to learn a new skill \u2014 graphic design, coding, whatever. Change your job. Hire a nanny to help with children. Invest the time you freed up into more deep work. This is a gradual upwards cycle of increasing intelligence.</p><p>Those of us who feel that the above is too long/hard and want something easier will simply remain stupid.</p><p>High Applied Intelligence lets us be captains of our lives.</p><h2>Part 2: invest time/energy into building intellectual wealth</h2><p>Key point: daily focus + biohacking = extreme intelligence</p><p>If we do a great job out of AI, we will have an enormous resource of energy and focused time. That (we can speculate) only <1% of us will ever achieve.</p><p>The question is what to invest it into. Key candidates:</p><ul><li>Further enhancements to AI\u2014 i.e. obsessively thinking about the reasons we did not hit our deep work goals and fixing them. Remember: this is the engine that powers everything else. Call distracted you? Turn on Do Not Disturb. Laptop discharged? Carry a battery. Braindead after lunch? Don\u2019t have lunch. Couldn\u2019t get back into flow after a 10am meeting? Don\u2019t have meetings until afternoon. And so on, ad infinitum.</li><li>Social Intelligence. Knowing how to persuade others boosts our intelligence far more than \u201cbook-smarts\u201d do. And it is extremely \u201cbiohackable\u201d \u2014 meditation, MDMA, higher testosterone, beta-blockers, SSRIs. These things can enhance our body language, make us confident, calm, empathetic and self-aware. This presses all the buttons of persuasion in other humans. Plus our vast deep work resource can be put to practicing body language in front of a mirror, reading the right books, writing persuasive articles. High SI is a superpower that makes life easy. And it is far more powerful than high IQ. The world just bends to accommodate what we want.</li><li>Dynamic Intelligence (i.e. learning to learn) + Classical Intelligence (i.e. IQ). We can probably directly boost these via things known to enhance neuroplasticity and adult neurogenesis. Nutrients/supplements like magnesium, choline, EPA/DHA, curcumin or bacopa monieri. Meds like SSRIs and lithium. Meditation and any other stress reduction. Making sleep extremely good. Intermittent fasting. Interval training. LSD or psilocybin. Modafinil is known to safely/directly enhance cognitive ability. More importantly, decades of high AI enable us to constantly learn new complex skills and ideas; make us smarter because we train our brains; and make enhancing all this an easy everyday habit.</li></ul><p>Last month I spent several days reading the (exceptional) Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini (THE guru of persuasion). Went slow. Took notes. Applied ideas to a public talk on biohacking the following week. Distilled the core concepts in a long recommendation-review for friends. This book became a mental model for human behavior. Many of its takeaways help make this article extremely persuasive.</p><p>This is one of many things deep work lets us do \u2014 truly understand, internalize and apply complex new ideas.</p><p>In the last year I read ~40 books + took ~8 online classes (list of recommendations here)+ learned to code; started a new company (Mirror Emoji Keyboard) + raised the highest-valuation Q1 seed round in Silicon Valley + launched a highly-rated product that may well create material financial wealth; wrote biohacking articles that reached millions of readers and helped meet amazing like-minded leaders in Silicon Valley; slept 8.5 hours on average (proofpic in sleep section!) + worked out every week and meditated every other day; made amazing new friends + went on awesome drug trips + had great sex + lived all over the world. Feel truly happy. And excited about continuing this growth trajectory every year for decades.</p><p>But let\u2019s compare with 5\u201310 years ago. I was unhappy, unproductive, fat (27% BF). Carried forward in life by some combination of luck, total denial, and extreme ambition. I was pretty stupid. And I\u2019d never admit it back then to others, or to myself, but my life fucking sucked. Suicidal thoughts appeared a couple times. Luckily never in a serious way.</p><p>The point is: biohacking can significantly enhance our lives. Let\u2019s use all the medical technology we can get to enhance our intelligence. Start now. Reinvest all of it over years and decades into building intellectual, financial, social and physiological wealth. Utilize the new technology that is coming. We will get to achieve everything we want. Lead the future. Be healthy and happy.</p><h1>PART 3: ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE ENHANCERS</h1><p>If you want a health-focused discussion, read the previous article. This one will mention some of the same things. Stuff that makes us healthy is mostly the same stuff that makes us intelligent. But this article is written specifically with the purpose of helping all of us enhance our intelligence.</p><p>(There is another, deeper, more interesting reason why I spent all the time writing this. It will become obvious by the end).</p><h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2><p>Do not mindlessly copy this. I do most of these things with a team of MDs with decades of medical experience led by Peter Attia, one of the top health-optimization doctors in the world.</p><p>If you read some of his articles on heart disease prevention, cholesterol, how ketosis enhances athletic performance, and why whether you are fat is not truly about calories you will appreciate the depth of thinking that goes into our decisions. Peter and his team really go after any of their recommendation with the same level of tenacity and dedication.</p><p>In particular, we do thousands of tests and know that our interventions do not carry much risk for me. But all of us have different bodies. For example I have kidney function with eGFR of >160 (in the top 1% of 30-year-olds), whereas you might not. This means your risks may be higher. Be cautious.</p><p>AGAIN: I am just a guy from the Internet. Not your doctor. I am not responsible for your health and am not telling you to follow my advice blindly.</p><h1>PART 3.1: APPLIED INTELLIGENCE \u2014 ENERGY & FOCUS</h1><h2>Sleep</h2><p>Key point: if you sleep less than 8 hours or go to sleep at inconsistent times, you are fucking yourself, making yourself stupid, and helping yourself get Alzheimers.</p><p>If anyone wants all the science, look into this book \u2014 it references hundreds of studies many of which the author (the director of the UC Berkeley Sleep Lab and one of the world\u2019s leading sleep neuroscientists) performed himself. Here we will just list the highlights.</p><p>Even minor sleep deprivation (sleeping 6\u20137 hours); circadian shift (changing sleep time by 1\u20132 hours a day from one night to the next); or reduction in Deep NREM or REM sleep reduce our intelligence in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Applied Intelligence: Severely lowered emotional control, stress resilience, willpower and focus. Significant increase in procrastination.</li></ul><ul><li>Hormonal misregulation. With consequences like worsened mood and lower energy. And smaller testicle size (yes, really). See chart above \u2014 the more you sleep the better your hormones get.</li><li>Significantly reduced immunity => more sickness => less productivity. They tested this by giving people rhinoviruses and depriving some of them of sleep. For science!</li><li>Dynamic Intelligence: Significantly worsened ability to remember what you learned the prior day AND worsened ability to learn the next day.</li><li>Classical Intelligence: Significantly worsened cognition and ability to see creative non-trivial solutions.</li><li>Social Intelligence: there are actual experiments showing sleep deprived people are less able to read facial expressions, are rated less attractive and persuasive etc.</li><li>Worsened clearance of waste from brain (occurs in deep NREM) => accumulation of Alzheimers-causing proteins => permanent damage to sleep enabling centers => further sleep degradation => we are fucked. I have a grandma with Alzheimers. And I would personally cryofreeze myself the second there were any indication I had it. If cryofreezing were not an option, I would prefer to die.</li></ul><p>Plus on top of the Things That Make Us Stupid above, we have: worsened insulin resistance, cancer, cardiovascular disease, car crash risk, athletic performance etc.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to link all the studies but it is in the book. Besides pretty sure most of us will know the above to be true from personal experience. I for one feel like a moron in the afternoon after undersleeping.</p><p>In other words, sleep is a major opportunity for intelligence enhancement. It impacts many other things. And for most of us, sleep quality is poor.</p><p>First a bit of important theory:</p><ul><li>Sleep is driven by two independent functions: accumulating sleep pressure (adenosine) and circadian rhythm (internal clock + melatonin). If these are not in-sync with each other, sleep quality declines.</li><li>Sleep has many different stages (REM, light NREM, deep NREM is a simple classification).</li><li>The stages (1) have very different functions (2) happen in different order, at different times of night, and depending on sleep pressure/circadian rhythm (3) are all essential.</li><li>Sleep is not actually a state where you are \u201cturned off\u201d; it is a stage of very active work throughout the brain and the body.</li></ul><p>What this means is that if we spend 7 hours in bed we sleep ~6 hours and cut out the last stages of sleep, degrading their unique functions by >80%. If we change our bedtime by 2 hours from one day to the next, we destroy the early stages of sleep and degrade their unique functions by >80%.</p><p>KEY POINT: you think sleeping 6 hours or going to sleep 2 hours later degrade sleep marginally, but actually they do so very severely.</p><p>So sleeping better means spending more time asleep, in the right sleep phases, at the right and consistent time of the day.</p><p>The first thing to do is measure. Peter, other leading health-optimizers and I recommend the Oura ring. Use the code \u201csergef\u201d to get $100 off their new version; I do not earn a referral fee from this (they kindly offered, I declined). The reason we prefer this particular device is that it gives far more accurate data than all the wristbands. Skin thickness, skin color, and contact tightness are all more favorable on fingers in terms of blood flow analysis.</p><p>Here are the key things we want:</p><ul><li>8 hours of actual sleep per day. This means we spend 8.5\u20139 hours in bed. I spend ~8:30 in bed on average, of which ~7:45 is sleep. Aiming to get to around 8:10 of sleep every day, so 9 hours in bed.</li><li>Same sleep time every day. When every day our sleep time shifts by hours, we are effectively living in a permanent state of jetlag. This de-synchronizes our sleep pressure from our circadian rhythm and destroys certain parts of sleep, especially deep NREM sleep.</li><li>1\u20132 hours of deep NREM sleep per day. According to data I\u2019ve seen from Oura this will be the biggest challenge for most of us. On a median day I get ~1:20; am aiming to get to 1:30 and make it consistently good (I sometimes have unexplained drops down to 20\u201330 minutes).</li><li>2+ hours of REM sleep per day. I get 2:45 on average and up to 5:30 when I do a lot of mental work. This is very high already.</li></ul><ul><li>Low, stable resting heart rate. We can see the rough reference ranges everyone quotes for different ages above. I\u2019m around 47 on great days, 56 on bad days, 52 on average, which is excellent. We want this to be low + stable during the night like in the graph above. This indicates highly restful sleep.</li><li>All this life-long</li></ul><p>To sleep better:</p><ul><li>Pick a sleep time where we spend 8.5\u20139 hours in bed and do not shift it by more than 20 minutes a day. This is incredibly hard in modern society and is the #1 thing that makes our sleep better.</li><li>Use blue-light-blocking glasses for 3\u20134 hours before going to sleep. Gunnars are good. Plus lately I\u2019ve been using these because they block even more blue light. They do look weird, but we have to decide whether our ego matters more than our health/intelligence.</li><li>Do not drink alcohol. Even a small amount degrades REM sleep which is the key part of sleep focused on intelligence. Interesting tidbit: the main difference between human and monkey sleep is that humans have more REM. So those of us who drink basically shift our sleep quality to monkey sleep and we can speculate as to long-term impacts of that. By the way \u2014 those studies about the benefits of red wine are bullshit, sorry.</li></ul><ul><li>Do not drink coffee or tea for 9 hours before sleep time (if a fast metabolizer) or at all (if a slow metabolizer). Caffeine half-life is surprisingly long. The graph above is average, but 50% of us (like me) metabolize much faster and 50% metabolize much slower and should not drink caffeine at all (for them it is associated with major health risks). The distinction is purely genetic and based on gene rs762551.</li><li>Sleep in cool temperatures (18 degrees Celsius; 65 Fahrenheit) and try out hot or cold showers before sleep. Low body temperature helps get into deep NREM sleep. I find that ice showers make me fall asleep very fast (counterintuitive).</li></ul><ul><li>Make sure our bedroom is totally dark and quiet. Use earplugs and sleep masks. Even sounds that do not wake us up actually make our sleep worse.</li><li>Exercise improves sleep, but do it >3 hours before bedtime. Consider not eating heavily for at least 3\u20134 hours before bedtime.</li><li>Sugar and carbohydrates reduce quality of deep NREM sleep. Yet another reason not to eat that shit.</li><li>Do not use sleeping pills. They make us lose consciousness but they actually don\u2019t make us sleep. These are different things.</li><li>Consider meditating or otherwise turning off before bed.</li></ul><p>Here\u2019s the thing: like most suggestions in this article the stuff above has compounding benefits. Each night of bad sleep permanently damages us and we can never fully recover that damage. Part of the damage is to the apparatus of sleep itself, which over time makes us stupid and ages and kills us.</p><p>Many of us do not want to make the changes to our social lives, dating etc. for the sake of sleep.</p><p>It is a matter of priorities. You want to go to the club, or you want to not have Alzheimers.</p><h2>Stress: do everything possible to lower it</h2><p>Key point: stressed out, negative, emotional people basically have long-term brain damage</p><p>Constant stress truly hurts everything: it makes cognition worse[1 2], drains energy, and even cuts adult neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in our brains [1 2]. Makes memory crap [1]. Interferes with hormonal systems [1]. It ages and kills us in many ways[1 2]. Here are another 50+ studies on how chronic stress fucks us up.</p><p>In other words, constant stress makes us stupid. Anything we can do to reduce it is a big win. Here are the specific tools I found useful for this:</p><ul><li>The SSRI antidepressant Escitalopram (I take 10mg/day) to boost serotonin. It eliminated \u201cbad mood days\u201d that used to happen 1\u20132 times a month. Reduced propensity to react to stress. Life just feels a little better all the time. It is also proven to enhance growth of new neurons in adult brains [1 2 3].</li></ul><p>Escitalopram is extremely safe even in large doses [1] especially for me because I have genes that are associated with significantly higher positives and lower negatives of this specific drug.</p><p>Old antidepressants (e.g. MAOI) are dangerous. There are also studies out there that claim even the latest, best antidepressants are bad for you [1]. My medical team is skeptical of those studies. The biggest reason is \u201csick cohort bias.\u201d These \u201cresearchers\u201d take a bunch of depressed people that are prescribed antidepressants, compare them with people NOT on antidepressants (while claiming to magically compensate for the fact that the latter group are obviously healthier people). Conclude that the AD group has a small difference in some kind of risk, and PR this to gullible media. This is bullshit, not science.</p><p>My doctors take SSRIs themselves and make no money from prescribing them to me. So I trust their conclusions.</p><ul><li>Lithium. We get ~1\u20133mg of it a day from water. It is prescribed to bipolar disorder patients in doses of 800mg-2000mg/day. I take 100mg/day (i.e. 10\u201320x less than a dose known to be safe). Reasons: (1) it is proven to enhance neurogenesis and is associated with a great number of medical benefits [here is a list of >50 studies on its various benefits] (2) subjectively it seems to drive a slight increase in my stress resilience. There appears to be no good reason not to be on lithium in this dose range.</li></ul><ul><li>Meditation. I meditate 30\u201345 minutes every day with a combination of mindfulness and freestyle-notation. Meditate \u201cin life\u201d while doing things from eating to listening to music to sitting on a skilift. My friends and I have a private Slack community where we keep shared meditation journals, and discuss them with a talented meditation coach. My meditation time is unstructured \u2014 a habit of meditating when in the back of a car, with a bit of free time, or just when bored. It\u2019s a much better use of time than mindlessly browsing the internet. Meditation gets better with time and coaching\u2014 now I\u2019m so good at it that I can dismiss an extremely strong emotion in 5 minutes just by observing its bodily manifestations.</li></ul><p>We can be completely non-religious and do not need to believe in any mystical bullshit that meditation is (sadly) surrounded with. There is a large amount of serious scientific evidence that suggests meditation is valuable for everything from neurogenesis to cognition, mood, attention, and disease risk [here is a collection of ~50 studies on this].</p><p>Once we are good at meditation, it provides very concrete applied hacks we can use. Here are some I use every day:</p><ol><li>Emotions are sets of specific bodily sensations [link]. Once they manifest, they are reinforced by loops of thoughts about them. So when you want to easily get rid of an emotion (e.g. loneliness or anger or self-doubt) you can sit down, find that emotion in your body, and pay close attention to it. This breaks the rumination cycle (because you aren\u2019t thinking) and reinforces your self-awareness (because you find emotion-driving bodily sensations => understand that your self-doubt is merely an itch). I can dismiss negative emotions in 30 sec \u2014 5 min. They just vanish.</li><li>I can see myself \u201cfrom the side.\u201d I have my eyes open and typing on laptop but I can also simultaneously see myself in front of me. This is easier to do with eyes closed, is a trainable skill, and is quite hard. The reason this is useful is that it lets you dissociate from your own emotions and ego. You can say to yourself \u201cwhy is that guy sitting over there annoyed about some work bullshit? He knows very well that various bullshit happens all the time, it is just a regular day.\u201d</li></ol><p>And it feels like in meditation I only just scratched the surface although I meditated (incorrectly) for 5 years. It is already easy for me to control my emotions. My goal this year is to get to a point where negative emotions don\u2019t even appear. This is feasible.</p><ul><li>Remove negative people from life. There are people who make us happy and energized and inspired, who we absorb new skills from, who we look forward to seeing. There are others who make us drained, who fill us with their own insecurities, fears and negativities. Even if the latter are our bosses, relatives, friends, spouses, we should reduce time with them. We can empathize, but it is not on us to fix other people. Hard enough to fix ourselves.</li></ul><p>Additionally, I saw material enhancements for stress resistance from things described in other sections. Most of all better sleep, sex, MDMA, removal of news/social media, and hormonal enhancements.</p><p>Last important point on stress: our propensity for it is a long-term thing.</p><p>Stress and fear increase the size and power of the amygdala (the part of our brain where fear is generated), which in turn makes it easier for us to be stressed and afraid.</p><p>If we are constantly fearful, stressed, depressed, negative, skeptical of others \u2014 we are \u201csick\u201d in the medical sense that our brain structure is doing something detrimental to us due to long-term damage. And it is detrimental \u2014 lots of scientific evidence for that (refer to all the studies listed above). We can get better, but it takes time and effort.</p><p>Actively work on keeping stress levels low. It doesn\u2019t just make us happier and healthier. It makes us significantly smarter.</p><h2>Sex: also a biohacking tool</h2><p>[Oct 2019: I edited this section to reflect my updated thoughts on the subject]</p><p>Apology to the female half of the audience. This section is male-oriented. That is what I know and optimize for.</p><p>Key points: Sex = good for you. Humans = not monogamous. When not in a relationship, I just hire fashion models to have sex with in order to save time on dating and focus on other priorities. Great sex = biochemistry.</p><p>I think of sex as something similar to exercise, meditation, or food. Another physiological need to be addressed in a time-efficient way; another tool to enhance health (talking about safe sex obviously) and intelligence. There are many reasons why sex is useful for intelligence:</p><ul><li>If we do not get it, we spend a lot of time thinking about it. Pursuing it, watching porn etc. Useless distractions.</li><li>Society is sexualized and ties the male ego to having sex. Doing so makes the ego content and easier to control.</li><li>Sex leads to favorable hormone profile changes that enhance mood, and reduce stress [1] and even help sleep [1]. Funnily enough I even noticed a very clear correlation between sex and my own deep sleep levels, and anything that improves deep sleep is very valuable.</li><li>There is evidence that sex boosts our neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. [1]</li></ul><p>Getting great sex takes too much time and energy:</p><ul><li>Dating to get sex rather than deep relationships takes a lot of time. Much of that time is wasted. On people who are not a good fit. On idiotic things like swiping on Tinder or going to clubs (screws with sleep). Casual dating = trading our time and energy for sex and reassuring our ego that we are desirable.</li><li>Monogamous long-term relationships can be great if we are together with someone who is a true friend and shares our values \u2014 I am in a long-term relationship which I deeply value right now. But monogamy is a challenging solution for sexual desires. Human biology is not monogamous. I quote: \u201cOverall, of the 1,231 cultures in the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, 84.6 percent are classified as polygynous [one man many women], 15.1 percent as monogamous, and 0.3 percent as polyandrous [one woman many men].\u201d [1].</li><li>What this means is humans are not wired for monogamy. And either cheat or are frustrated in relationships. Neither of which I can accept. This applies to men and to women, yet women have a worse deal \u2014 society shames them for not being monogamous whereas men have tacit approval from society for pursuing their sexual urges. \u201cPlayer\u201d is positive, \u201cslut\u201d is not.</li><li>Just straight up paying for sex in one-time cash meetings off the Internet is frankly emotionally-unpleasant.</li><li>Masturbation doesn\u2019t deliver the same benefits for some reason. It seems we do trick our brains, but not fully.</li></ul><p>My solution at this point in life is simple:</p><ul><li>I have agents from the Russian/European modeling industry that set up dates/sex for me (that I pay for, they arrange all logistics, I don\u2019t have to do anything at all).</li><li>This whole thing is surprisingly well-organized. Think \u201cmessenger bot or closed instagram profile that sends ~50 new portfolios a day \u2014 high-profile, detailed portfolios with videos, links to magazine covers and instagram profiles.\u201d</li><li>If I hit it off with particular girls (which happened a number of times), we just keep meeting when we feel like it. With no expectations of relationships or any claim on each other.</li><li>There are easy ways to hack emotional chemistry. Meditate or carefully take the right drugs together, have sex right after a gym workout upped hormones, do fun stuff like go to a swing club.</li><li>A big reason I decided this is optimal is all the \u201crich guy harasses women\u201d stories. This way everyone unambiguously and honestly consents. With clear expectations. And a data trail.</li></ul><p>Basically: I get to have sex with women I find attractive, when I feel like it. All the psychological and physiological value of sex, with very little time or emotional cost. Helps me have more appreciation for the long-term relationships I have because I satisfy sexual urges and feel free without a sense of resentment at my girlfriend for restricting me. And no risks because everyone\u2019s happy.</p><p>Society tells us that \u201cthe right kind\u201d of sex needs X months/dates of knowing each other to be good. And of course it must \u201cnot be based on looks or money\u201d (a theory easily disproved by the existence of makeup and Lamborghinis).</p><p>In reality awesome sex just needs the right biochemical buttons pressed. That is all.</p><p>A lot of you do the stuff I do quietly. Or fantasize about doing it. Just do it openly. You will look confident and empowered. The world does not get to tell you not to do what you want.</p><p>BTW, the right long-term relationships can be amazing and valuable. I want these to be honest and based on a genuine connection. Not on \u201cI am really horny, I\u2019m going to go waste my time to pick up women I actually have zero long-term interest in.\u201d</p><p>Finally, if you think it is \u201cmisogyny\u201d to pursue your own desires and encourage everyone, regardless of gender, to do the same, you may want to look up the definition of \u201cmisogyny\u201d.</p><h2>Hormones:</h2><p>Key point: your hormones are probably screwed up. Fix them, it improves mood, energy and health. And generally makes life awesome.</p><p>For reasons related to modern life (stress, poor sleep, pollution etc.) most of us will have suboptimal hormones.</p><p>This is hard to fix without expensive professional help and testing. But it is really worth exploring. The general idea is:</p><ol><li>test all of our hormonal systems a number of times</li><li>understand the research or get a high-quality endocrinologist to identify opportunities (e.g. if TSH is >2, we may have an opportunity related to thyroid function).</li><li>explore interventions, try them, see how we feel, test biomarkers again.</li><li>optimize and repeat</li></ol><p>I had \u201cbelow average but clinically normal\u201d levels of thyroid hormones and of testosterone. Boosted both via targeted interventions described in my previous post.</p><p>This improved mood and boosted energy in quite a material way. Plus testosterone is quite important for Social Intelligence (explained in a later section). It increases confident, aggressive, dominant behavior as well as willingness to take risks. The associated body language and behaviors make it easier to get people to listen to what you say and do what you want.</p><h2>Intermittent Fasting:</h2><p>Key point: eating once a day makes you smarter and healthier.</p><p>I eat only one time a day \u2014 late afternoon / early evening, and fast for 24 hours. I do this nearly every day. This:</p><ul><li>Has major health benefits by promoting autophagy (the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was granted to the discoverer of this mechanism), reducing probabilities of cancer, heart disease and Alzheimers.</li><li>Saves a lot of time. Eating once a day is a huge time win because it removes context switching.</li><li>Prevents the afternoon slump and keeps our mind sharp for longer.</li><li>Directly enhances intelligence via improved BDNF/neuroplasticity.</li></ul><p>Here are ~70 supporting studies. There is very wide scientific consensus that IF is great for you.</p><p>Basically it makes us smarter, saves valuable time and makes us healthier. Think of how big of an advantage it is to have an additional hour of sharp focus a day for 30 years. And we will live longer!</p><p>It is also natural. All that stupid shit about eating breakfast and eating 5 times a day ignores the very obvious question: do you actually think you evolved to have an around-the-clock buffet? do you think the hunter-gatherers ate 5 times a day?</p><p>This is really a no-brainer. A bit hard at first, but the body and mind adapt quickly.</p><h2>Dietary Ketosis</h2><p>Key point: your body and mind work much better if you do not eat sugar, processed foods and grains. Because guess fucking what? Evolution designed you to mostly eat fat!</p><p>A simplified explanation of ketosis is that we are switching our bodies into burning fat rather than glucose. This requires eating nearly all our calories from fat, and can be measured quite precisely via finger blood sticks.</p><p>The fundamental argument why ketosis is good is as follows:</p><ul><li>For one oxidative reaction, ketone breakdown delivers more energy (20\u201330% more) than glucose breakdown [1]. It is basically a cleaner fuel that \u201crusts\u201d all our systems less per unit of performance delivered. My doctor Peter Attia does a great job of explaining the details in a series of articles here [1].</li><li>I can hear you arguing \u201cyeah right, so evolution didn\u2019t build us this way and Serge thinks he can hack his body\u2019s metabolism to be 20\u201330% more efficient.\u201d Actually \u2014 this is returning us to what evolution built us for. Before we started cultivating grain, carbohydrates and sugars were rarely available. We could basically only get them from berry bushes and beehives. High dietary fat consumption and ketosis is our natural state.</li></ul><p>There is a great deal of evidence that suggests ketosis is advantageous. Here\u2019s another 70+ studies if you want to read about it.</p><p>The problem is that ketosis is very hard in the modern world. Much harder than intermittent fasting. The reason is that sugars and carbohydrates are everywhere + that they are very addictive. And in order to be in ketosis, we really have to eat close to zero sugars and our carbs have to be limited to a small amount of fruit + what we will get from vegetables.</p><p>It looks like there is interesting technology on the horizon \u2014 HVMN, a biohacking company funded by Marc Andreessen, has developed the first commercial-grade ketone ester that really does raise ketones rapidly and significantly (I got 0.5=>3.4 in 15 minutes for those in the know), and reduces blood glucose. The older ketone salt products don\u2019t get nearly as good of a result.</p><p>When I took their ketone ester (note: I am not earning any referral fees or the like from them although I am friends with the founder), I felt a rapid and lasting inflow of energy/focus. Another particularly acute effect was needing to breathe less \u2014 in normal activity, in the sauna, and in an interval run.</p><p>Right now this is expensive (~$3000/month to stay in keto all day) and unpleasant (the stuff tastes\u2026 really bad although Geoff, the CEO, is saying this will be fixed shortly). Hopefully both will get better. I really like the effects I perceived so far, as well as the science behind ketone health benefits. Will probably take this every day on top of my on-and-off keto diet.</p><h2>Exercise:</h2><p>Not much to add to what I wrote in my previous article \u2014 do interval training (not bullshit long cardio or marathons), do heavy hip hinge exercises, sit less. This likely contributes to intelligence via hormonal systems, sleep, stress control etc.; and even if it did not you would want to do it for the health benefits.</p><h2>Distractions and Addictive Cognitive Garbage: Eliminate Them</h2><p>Key point: technology, notifications and news media are vampires that suck our time and energy.</p><p>Many things require deep, focused work. Switching contexts is expensive. If we are distracted from writing code by a 5-minute phone call we do not lose 5 minutes, we might lose hours of excellent work.</p><p>There is more. Every time a notification, a phone call, a YouTube video distract us, our neural networks get rewired. We become more distractible. Less able to focus. More addicted to these things.</p><p>We become more stupid.</p><p>Modern tech and media are deliberately designed to make us addicted. Couple quotes from top Facebook executives about this:</p><ul><li>\u201cYour behaviors \u2014 you don\u2019t realize it but you are being programmed\u2026 you gotta decide how much you are willing to give up, how much of your intellectual independence,\u201d \u201cmy solution is I just don\u2019t use these tools anymore. I haven\u2019t for years.\u201d \u201c[my kids] are not allowed to use this shit.\u201d \u2014 Chamath Palihapitiya, former head of Growth for Facebook [1]</li><li>\u201cThe thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them, \u2026 was all about: \u2018How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\u2019\u2026exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you\u2019re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.\u201d \u2014 Sean Parker, former President of Facebook [2]</li></ul><p>This is not limited to social applications. The news media, from Buzzfeed to the New York Times, are overhyping threats, optimizing clickbait-y headlines, and generally doing everything they can to make us care about things that are actually totally fucking irrelevant to our lives.</p><p>That\u2019s right \u2014 the news media that claims to keep us informed and complains about Facebook designing addictive technologies actually thrives on hijacking our minds, sucks our time and energy. And directly makes us more stressed, negative, stupid people.</p><p>Do you really want to spend your days and limited attention resources worrying about what Kim Jong-Un will do? Why. The fuck. Do you. Care?</p><p>(If you think worrying about Kim Jong-Un in fact does provide value, I challenge you to post in the comments a list of specific decisions that reading the political news helped you make in 2017, and what concrete, valuable outcomes resulted from these decisions).</p><p>Here are some ideas on how we can approach this challenge:</p><ul><li>This is my iPhone Home screen. It is deliberately designed to be uncluttered and trigger me to read books (Kindle), listen to podcasts and audiobooks (Overcast, Audible) and use my latest product (Mirror Emoji Keyboard). Consider removing Safari and messengers from this screen because although they are indispensable, we do not want to cue our mind to use them. There was a noticeable effect \u2014 after I got them out of sight, I stopped checking them without a good reason. Also my iPhone is switched into greyscale and dimmed (but I can\u2019t screenshot it). The idea is to make everything less colorful/attractive/addictive (you can do this in Accessibility).</li></ul><ul><li>My desktop is similarly uncluttered and minimalistic.</li><li>All my phone notifications are off except Calendar and Uber. Facebook, Instagram and similar apps are deleted.</li></ul><ul><li>I have a VPN both on my Mac and on my iPhone that bans web traffic to social media and all news sites at all times.</li><li>I add this blacklist of sites to the Mac Hosts file so that it is harder to get around the ban. Here\u2019s a guide to doing this.</li><li>I do use messengers/email, but no notifications. Trying to get to no more than 2\u20133 blocks of responses a day. I rarely pick up the phone, and never from unknown callers. Sure, we can lose some opportunities, but really, who gives a fuck? Life is full of opportunities if we have a lot of time and energy.</li><li>I live in hotels. But if I ever buy a house, it will also be designed to trigger correct behaviors. From uncluttered rooms that cause focus, to pictures of sugar next to cancer cells in the kitchen. This shit works.</li><li>I have not turned on a TV channel a single time for at least 10 years. Not exaggerating.</li><li>There are physical hacks that can help stay focused by reducing incoming sensory data. My favorite are Etymotic earplugs + Bose Active Noise Cancelation headphones on top; and hoodies to reduce visual field. Useful when attractive women are around :) . I read somewhere that those of you who go to memory competitions buy blacked-out glasses and drill holes in them to further minimize vision field when focused. Want to try this, it actually makes a ton of sense given how much brainpower our vision uses.</li><li>I ignore nearly all requests; meet with people only if I can learn something from them or they are friends; and almost never have meetings before 2pm.</li><li>There\u2019s lots of other things. The key point is that I relentlessly seek out reasons why I couldn\u2019t get enough flow on a particular day and prune these reasons.</li></ul><p>Some of you might feel this is extreme and not worth the time investment. Track how many hours you waste away on procrastination, social media, news articles etc. in a typical month. For me that number used to be several hours a day and is now approaching zero. Our investment in controlling our infospace pays for itself many times over. And it is easy once habituated.</p><p>This section is also the reason I choose not to have children. None of us will disagree that children are extremely distracting, disrupt sleep for years; are generally a massive cost of time, focus and energy; and have material risks of not working out, for reasons outside our control.</p><p>I just don\u2019t see the ROI in children given my goals. They won\u2019t ever return my time, focus or energy back. There is no point in passing on our genes once we can live forever ourselves (and there are good reasons to think some of us will do so). We can have other meaningful long-term projects. And if we ever feel lonely we can take MDMA with friends or boost our hormones and neurotransmitters. True happiness is in our biochemistry state. We can have it without intermediate steps.</p><h2>PART 3.2: SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE \u2014 PERSUASION</h2><h2>Social Intelligence: much more intelligent than IQ</h2><p>Bad news for the high-IQ introverts amongst us. Donald Trump is smarter than we are.</p><p>He repeatedly survived through bankruptcies that would have destroyed most of us if we were in his place. Played the media like a fiddle. Became president of the US. And he isn\u2019t a lucky one-hit wonder. He has been achieving for decades things that the majority of us would very much like to achieve.</p><p>This is not an endorsement of him. I do not like what he does. But his \u201cability to perform complex tasks\u201d (i.e. intelligence) is high. And it is based in SI. Body language. An understanding of human emotional buttons. That the human brain equates attention and credibility. Even if you really dislike him it makes sense to learn some of his techniques.</p><p>(I entered into a $20k bet on Trump winning the presidency 15 months before the election. For those of us with high social intelligence, it was always obvious Trump would win).</p><p>We should recognize that Social Intelligence is far, far, far more powerful than IQ. The reason Social Intelligence is so powerful is that it scales. An understanding of human emotional buttons enables us to get others to like and support us with their skills \u2014 no matter who they are.</p><p>A high IQ and ability to debate with formal logic is useful too of course. Planes don\u2019t fly on emotions. But if we, after a lifetime of observing ourselves and other humans, think we can use logic/facts/IQ to persuade/lead/connect with others, we are truly fucking stupid.</p><p>There is a lot of evidence that Social Intelligence and social status have many second-order effects on intelligence: neurogenesis, happiness, intelligence, brain volume, desire to compete, lower stress etc. Here is a whole book full of supporting evidence by Robert Sapolsky, a leading neurologist at Stanford. And lest we think this is just because of human social inequality, a great deal of the research is replicated even for monkey social intelligence and social status (read the book).</p><p>So \u2014 how do we boost it?</p><p>The prerequisite is to truly internalize that humans are \u201cirrational.\u201d But the irrationality is highly predictable. We have to understand and believe this, at our deepest core.</p><p>Favorite example of \u201cirrationality\u201d (I am well aware of that priming studies are controversial):</p><p>When we hear French music in a wine store our preferences are materially shifted to French wines. Even if we don\u2019t ever become aware of the music.</p><p>The reason things work this way is actually highly logical.</p><p>Somewhere in our mind there are neural nets for France, French Music, French Wine, French Flag image. They are linked to each other. That is how we know these are related in some way. Triggering the French Music net triggers all linked nets, including the nets for France and French Wine. So the incoming signal to the French Wine net is a bit stronger than into the Italian Wine net at this moment in time. That changes our decision probabilities. Without us ever noticing.</p><p>All of us are programmable, hackable machines.</p><p>So \u2014 how can biohacking help our SI?</p><ul><li>Body language, eye contact and voice tonality have greater persuasive impact than the words we say. Biochemistry impacts these things. For example testosterone is both a cause and a consequence of confident body language [here\u2019s a TED talk about this]. Looking and acting dominant in turn enhances our persuasion effectiveness \u2014 other humans are much more interested in what we have to say. And this bias towards confidence is so deeply ingrained that it will remain for as long as we are human. I raise my testosterone a lot via customized therapies (see my previous article for details).</li><li>All the antistress tools \u2014 SSRIs, Lithium etc. \u2014 further enhance your body language of relaxed confidence. We all want to interact with positive, confident, un-stressed people.</li><li>Recently a top Silicon Valley entrepreneur told me he uses beta blockers to be calm in big public talks. I then found out this is a favorite of concert pianists amongst you. Haven\u2019t tried yet, but just got some propranolol. Sounds like an awesome idea. If in a stressful negotiation we have a cool head and a heart rate of 70 while the counterparty is at 120+, we have a material intellectual advantage.</li><li>MDMA has its whole separate section.</li><li>There are many other hacks. If I want to be aggressive/passionate in a public setting I do a set of 50 pushups right before. If I want to be more calm, I meditate.</li></ul><ul><li>The most important thing is that with our huge Applied Intelligence reserves we can invest into SI. Read books [my list includes some favorites on the topic]. Watch videos of ourselves and practice in front of a mirror. Do public talks. Write persuasive blog articles. Have deep conversations with friends & family. Study neuroscience classes. Over the decades we can become what Scott Adams calls a Master Persuader [read his awesome book on persuasion, Trump, and why humans are not rational].</li></ul><h2>MDMA: the Social Intelligence Drug</h2><p>Recently I gave a talk about biohacking to an audience of ~200 successful leaders in San Francisco. When I asked how many of them took the drug MDMA (Schedule 1 illegal in the US), >50% of hands went up.</p><p>Think about that for a second.</p><p>I am not telling you to take it. But in my subjective experience, MDMA boosted Social Intelligence more than anything else. Its effects were permanent and extremely beneficial.</p><p>The scientific research says that risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) appear to be far lower than those of alcohol and tobacco [here are several studies; this is obvious to anyone who ever looked at the science]. The FDA is about to approve it for treatment of PTSD and says it is a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d [1].</p><p>The setting I take it in is long, chill house parties with friends/family, great music and ambience, known supply with precise measurement.</p><p>For those of us who haven\u2019t tried it: the effects are:</p><ul><li>Social anxieties and ego vanish. We feel free to tell others what we genuinely think and feel, without worrying about being judged. We might think we do these things anyway, but this is a different level of emotional openness, confidence and freedom.</li><li>We greatly enjoy interacting with those around us and feel deep empathy for them. We are extremely extroverted \u2014 building a deep connection with someone we just met is trivial.</li><li>There is no self-talk about future or past. We are completely in the moment, like after an intensely deep meditation.</li></ul><p>The interesting thing is that for me all the effects above stayed permanently, albeit they are not as strong while actually on MDMA.</p><p>The biggest benefit is that I became extremely comfortable with being open about who I am and what I feel. In this article I publicly admit to taking illegal drugs and paying for sex. It is trivially easy for me to say what my biggest insecurity used to be (height \u2014 5'8 and spent years agonizing over it) or the most embarrassing lie in my life (lied about getting into Stanford GSB before I actually did; it got to the Dean of Admissions; I\u2019m still not sure how I persuaded him to let me in despite this). All my friends and family read these articles BTW.</p><p>It is extremely liberating to not care at all about what other people think of us. And just be who we are.</p><p>And here\u2019s the thing: we all LOVE those of us who are so open and honest. It makes us interesting. Memorable. Trustworthy. Relatable. Confident. It makes it easy to get into deep conversations, which builds relationships. It is soooooo much easier to get what we want in life when we have no fears and just directly ask for it. And so few of us use this extremely powerful hack.</p><p>Alcohol (88,000 deaths/yr in the US), tobacco (480,000 deaths) and opioid painkillers (15,000 deaths) are legal, but MDMA (50 deaths) is not. Clearly many of us understand this and do not respect this law (>50% in my San Francisco sample openly said they used MDMA, while just about nobody smoked tobacco).</p><p>Unscientific and irrational drug laws undermine the moral authority of law as a whole.</p><h1>PART 3.3: DYNAMIC & CLASSICAL INTELLIGENCE \u2014 IQ AND THE ABILITY TO LEARN</h1><h2>Modafinil: proven to enhance our Applied and Classical Intelligence</h2><p>A recent study at Oxford reviewed all English studies on Modafinil over 25 years, and concluded that Modafinil significantly enhances the attention, executive function and learning (i.e. intelligence, in its most clear form imaginable) of healthy non-sleep-deprived humans when performing complex tasks, and with no side effects or mood changes at all. [1].</p><p>I take 100\u2013200mg every day in the morning (as early as possible) and plan to always do so. Anecdotally some people find their sleep is disrupted.</p><p>The country that first decides to give free Modafinil to all its citizens will reap massive competitive benefits in the global economy.</p><h2>Adderall: has its uses</h2><p>I used to take Adderall XR (daily for many years). Adderall is very effective and quite safe (here\u2019s a huge review of the science, and it clearly suggests Adderall can give you superhuman concentration with not much real risk).</p><p>I switched to Modafinil because I found that Adderall made me more anxious + made it too easy to focus on unimportant things.</p><p>I still take it occasionally when I need to do something boring but important. For example in my last company I read/edited key legal documents on Adderall. And the mechanisms I built in gave negotiating advantages years later. When reviewing 200 pages of dense legalese, a $1000/hr investor lawyer gets obliterated by a founder on Adderall.</p><p>But overall I do not recommend it. Too powerful.</p><h2>Neurogenesis, Neuroplasticity & Learning</h2><p>Key point: many things in this article help you grow new neurons. that helps you learn. if you do not constantly learn new and challenging things, your intelligence degrades. oh, and LSD.</p><p>Learning itself is a skill that needs to be developed. For a general overview of the neurobiology of learning I highly recommend completing the Learning How To Learn class on Coursera. It is easy and very valuable for all of us \u2014 those in high school, and those who are CEOs alike.</p><p>Learning is dependent on neuroplasticity and neurogenesis \u2014 i.e. the ability of our brain to grow new neurons and rewire synaptic connections between existing neurons. These are driven by something called BDNF, which is highly modifiable.</p><p>We already mentioned that a number of things enhance these: lithium, SSRIs, sleep, meditation, stress reduction, sex, fasting. Here are some more:</p><ul><li>Supplements. The ones I take: EPA/DHA Omega-3, Magnesium, Curcumin, Niacin, Rhodiola, Bacopa. You can read about all of these at Examine.com.</li><li>Exercise, especially high-intensity interval training.</li><li>LSD [bunch of related studies in Nature]</li></ul><p>Here\u2019s another 50+ supporting studies.</p><p>The last bit about LSD deserves a separate mention. I recently began microdosing LSD. Interesting experience. No hallucinations, but the mind wanders, focuses intensely on various sensory inputs, and links ideas in novel and unpredictable ways. I find it impossible to do focused work. But it seems to be an incredible way to deeply enjoy things like music, art or even taking a bath. It also seems to be a very powerful way to shift the mind into a diffuse mode of thought after a period of intense focus, which is essential for learning (watch the class referenced above for details). LSD even in large doses is extremely safe. I will keep using them from time to time when I want a day off. NOTE: do not mix LSD and lithium.</p><p>If you are the kind of person who looks down on those who take illegal drugs, you should know that Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Richard Feynman, Thomas Edison and many other top businesspeople, scientists and leaders used illegal drugs and often spoke of them as crucial to their success.</p><p>And of course to improve our learning skills we need to keep learning. We can teach ourselves to code or complete classes on neuroscience or genetics or quantum physics or French or playing the piano, rather than spend our precious time and neurons on the failings of politicians, the habits of celebrities, or the details of terrorist attacks. Even if we don\u2019t ever use quantum physics, learning it will make us smarter and more capable of learning any other concepts, as well as link them to quantum physics in novel ways.</p><h2>Supplements:</h2><p>This article is already long enough. I take lots of supplements \u2014 50+ pills a day (that\u2019s an actual picture above). They are basically super-safe things (e.g. concentrated garlic) that can have plausible benefits. More details in the health article.</p><h2>Avoiding pollution and toxins</h2><p>Key point: pollution and especially smoking damages your brain.</p><p>It is well known that many pollutants damage intellect directly (lead, mercury); have broadly negative neurological effects (volatile organic compounds such as styrene); and disrupt hormone signaling (xenoestrogens are linked to long-term testosterone decline observed around the world).</p><p>I try to avoid all of these as much as possible. On a practical level this means:</p><ul><li>Try to live in a clean air area + spend time in well-ventilated spaces. I\u2019m looking forward to someone creating a convenient and not too scary personal air filter mask that I could wear when in cities.</li><li>Don\u2019t drink hot liquids from plastic containers and generally try to avoid plastics near your food.</li><li>Eat expensive local/organic food. We don\u2019t really know what is in it of course. But expensive food is a game of probabilities. Cheap food is guaranteed to be full of various shit from antibiotics to pesticides. That\u2019s how they make it cheap.</li></ul><ul><li>Don\u2019t smoke or spend time near smokers. Nicotine is a nootropic, but all the other shit in cigarettes \u2014 benzene, styrene etc. \u2014 doesn\u2019t just give us cancer, it makes us fucking stupid in the clearest sense of the word. Here is a quote from the US EPA: \u201cexposure to styrene in humans results in effects on the central nervous system (CNS), such as headache, fatigue, weakness, depression and CSN dysfunction.\u201d [1]</li></ul><p>I know I used the word \u201cstupid\u201d many times in this article but it all pales in comparison with the stupidity of smoking.</p><h2>Placebo</h2><p>Many of these interventions are likely to carry significant placebo effects. Placebo is awesome. If we have genuine belief in the efficacy of an intervention, that belief itself generates part of the desired effect. This is one of the most proven observations in medical science.</p><p>Optimism is healthy and good for us in and of itself.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I made this point many times. But this stuff compounds. Think about how smart you will become if you have decades of focused learning, awesome sleep, great health, practicing social skills, building wealth and power. An upwards spiral that others will never catch up with. And because gains in society are exponentially concentrated at the very top, gains from maximizing your intelligence are large.</p><p>And deep work habits also train us to have \u201cdeep downtime.\u201d To have deeply engaging conversations with our friends and family, where we show our vulnerabilities and get to the core of who we are. Rather than staring at our phones and distractedly discussing the weather (as most of us do).</p><p>This whole approach isn\u2019t just healthy and useful to create wealth and influence. It is also a fucking awesome way to live.</p><h1>PART 3: CONCLUSION</h1><p>It is not the ability to easily multiply large numbers, but the ability to consistently win, that makes AlphaGo superintelligent in the (very narrow) domain of playing Go.</p><p>Likewise we are intelligent if we accomplish complex goals. Stupid if we do not. That intelligence is based on our biochemistry.</p><p>This article is about executing extremely well. You should also pick the right goal and tie it together on different timeframes.

I changed names as well, except for Henry\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019m on the bus to go see my son Henry at the hospital. I have to take him in a taxi to another hospital for some specialist doctor appointments they don\u2019t do at the hospital at which he lives. I don\u2019t want to take him on the bus to the other hospital because I don\u2019t want to have to jostle with other curious passengers when I have to turn on his suction machine to suck out the saliva and mucus that collects in his tracheotomy tube. He would love to go on the bus though. He\u2019s two. Despite the physical disabilities he has from the surgery to remove his brain tumor, he\u2019s very sharp mentally and gets as excited about a big red double decker bus as any other little boy. I\u2019ll take him on a bus soon and if it makes anyone uncomfortable they can suck my dick. Metaphorically; my family needs me too much for me to get sent to prison for trying to force a stranger to suck my dick on a bus. I do pass two prisons on the way to the hospital though so maybe it could work.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking tired. The front of my head feels like it\u2019s stuffed with hot trash. My chest and throat feel constricted and I\u2019m reminded that while my life is and will remain stressful for the foreseeable future, I could at least lose some weight to reduce my heart\u2019s workload, so a cardiac event doesn\u2019t take me out before I turn fifty.</p><p>My biggest fear had always been that I wind up somehow being conscious for eternity. Like that I die, wind up in heaven or hell or wherever and I remain \u201cme\u201d and just never shut off and have to endure being conscious and aware and nothing is wonderful enough or horrible enough to engage me for that long, i.e. eternity. That might be a factor in the heavy drinking I quit fifteen years ago; the idea that I could really effectively hit my own consciousness\u2019 kill switch as needed. Might also be why I\u2019ve always enjoyed naps more than food or money.</p><p>That fear went away when my wife and I had kids. Or boys, specifically. My sperm only makes boys for some reason. The fear went away because I realized I could now do eternity and be okay. I could just call to mind the image of one of my sons, or the smell of their heads, or the feel of one of their little feet in my hand and I\u2019d be happy. Give me a Polaroid of one of them to hold on to and I could do two eternities.</p><p>I may wish Henry wasn\u2019t in the hospital and it may make me fucking sick that my kids haven\u2019t lived under the same roof for over a year. But I\u2019m always, always happy to enter the hospital every morning and see him. It\u2019s exciting every day to walk into his room and see him and see him see me. The surgery to remove his tumor left him with Bell\u2019s palsy on the left side of his face, so it\u2019s slack and droops. His left eye is turned inward too, due to nerve damage. But the right side of his face is incredibly expressive, and that side brightens right up when I walk into the room. There\u2019s no doubt about what kind of mood he\u2019s in, ever. It\u2019s particularly precious when he\u2019s angry because seeing the contrast between a toddler\u2019s naked rage in one half of his face and an utterly placid chubby chipmunk cheek and wandering eye in the other is shocking in a way that makes me and my wife and whatever combination of nurses and/or doctors are in the room laugh every time. And when he smiles, forget about it. A regular baby\u2019s smile is wonderful enough. When a sick baby with partial facial paralysis smiles, it\u2019s golden. Especially if it\u2019s my baby.</p><p>A little over a year ago Henry vomited at his oldest brother\u2019s fifth birthday party. No big deal; he was our third kid and we\u2019d cleaned up enough gallons of puke not to be fazed. I\u2019d been feeding him blueberries so there were maybe fifteen or twenty recognizable blueberries in there. Did I feed him too many? Had I done something wrong? He was eleven months old at the time. Was I being a lazy parent and had I just let him keep eating them because it kept him quiet? Those questions ran through my mind but if he\u2019d puked them all up it didn\u2019t really matter. He was our third; I\u2019m pretty sure I let him eat chorizo before he was nine months old. It\u2019s not like your first kid where you bug out over every little thing that goes into their mouth. Want some chorizo? Go nuts little man. Chorizo\u2019s good, why wouldn\u2019t you want some? I\u2019m glad I gave it to him too because he hasn\u2019t eaten anything via his mouth for a year now. Now he\u2019s fed through a tube in his stomach. Some shit called Pediasure Peptide. One nurse I know hates it because it smells the same when kids vomit it up as it does fresh out of the bottle. And kids on chemo vomit a lot. So she feels like she\u2019s feeding kids vomit.</p><p>After Henry vomited that first time at his brother\u2019s birthday party, we cleaned it up and kept on partying. The next day he vomited a couple more times so my wife called a nurse who said to bring him into Accidents and Emergency. She wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t get dehydrated. For some reason at the A and E they got the idea he might have a urinary tract infection. Since he couldn\u2019t really keep fluids down very well, they asked me to feed him five mils of some electrolyte juice through a syringe every 5 minutes and hold a little cup next to his penis to catch any urine he might produce so they could see if it was in fact a UTI. That was actually fun, holding a cup under his adorable little eleven-month old penis and nursing him little squirts of juice every five minutes. It was sort of meditative and we just stared at each other the whole time. I couldn\u2019t look at my phone or watch Finding Nemo on the A and E TV, lest I miss a drop of that precious pee he was resisting giving me. He finally made a little pee and I gave it to them and we left with some antibiotics, with the understanding they\u2019d call us and tell us if a UTI was the culprit.</p><p>He continued to vomit, but it tapered off a bit and it seemed like he was at least taking in more calories then he\u2019d bring back up onto the floor from time to time. Still though we were concerned so we brought him to our local general practitioner. A doctor examined him and while we were there, Henry vomited all over the floor. I was glad he vomited in front of the doctor. I wanted to point at the vomit on the floor and say, \u201cSee asshole? That\u2019s vomit alright. Now what are you going to do about it?\u201d What he did was give us an appointment to see a gastroenterologist. That made sense to me, since up to that point in my life, vomit-related issues generally centered in the stomach.</p><p>The vomiting plateaued a bit and we decided to keep the plans we\u2019d had to visit the United States for the Easter holiday. Henry turned one. Then the vomiting intensified. While visiting my mom in Massachusetts we took Henry to an American hospital. For a five-hundred-dollar deposit, they did an ultrasound on his kidneys to see if they were infected. They didn\u2019t seem to be. They put him on different antibiotics. We returned to London and started to get scared. Henry was losing weight. Every time he vomited I would freak out. I would feed him so gently, so slowly, and assume I\u2019d done something wrong when he vomited. Why, if I\u2019d been able to feed Henry\u2019s ravenous, feral older brothers, couldn\u2019t I feed him? I would imagine collecting the vomit somehow and pouring it back into him with a funnel. My baby was getting smaller, and that is a fucked up thing to see. The total amount he weighed was less than the amount of weight I should lose. Henry didn\u2019t have any weight to lose! His vomit became the most precious substance in the world to me and I would often start crying whenever he threw up. I would try not to cry in front of his older brothers and fail and they\u2019d ask why, and I would say it was because I was scared.</p><p>The gastroenterologist prescribed a drug that\u2019s supposed to make you not puke. He puked anyway. By this point we knew we were going to get some kind of bad news, we just prayed it would be celiac disease or a twist in his gut that could be surgically fixed or something.</p><p>Then my friend Brian, whose kids are older than ours, recommended we go see their family pediatrician. He said he\u2019d helped them solve a medical mystery with their son a few years ago and what the hell, it was worth a shot.</p><p>Like every other appointment, I took Henry to Dr. Anson myself. My wife is a magnificent mom and is insane about our children and would have happily taken Henry but for whatever reason I\u2019d taken him to the first appointment so we just kind of stuck with that and he became my little project. My wife stayed with our older boys who were five and three and were, frankly, usually the more difficult job posting.</p><p>Dr. Anson called Henry and I into his office. He was pleasant and probably in his late sixties. He checked out Henry and was as alarmed as anyone to see the loose skin on his inner thighs.</p><p>He asked some routine questions but then he asked one that stuck out from the others: \u201cIs his vomiting effortless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEffortless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, does he retch, or seem distressed when he vomits? Or does it just come up and out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, huh, um, it is effortless, yeah. He\u2019s not troubled at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think we should schedule an MRI. Of his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust to make sure there\u2019s nothing in there that shouldn\u2019t be. Pressing on his emetic center, making him vomit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like a tumor?\u201d</p><p>He paused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you said it.\u201d</p><p>Henry just turned two. We didn\u2019t dare assume he\u2019d have a second birthday with the prognosis he received after they took out the tumor and confirmed what kind it was. It was a real cunt of a tumor. An ependymoma they call it. Ependymomas kill most babies who get them. If I\u2019d had one when I was Henry\u2019s age in the 1970s I would\u2019ve almost certainly died. You probably would have too if you\u2019re old enough to be fucked up enough to want to read a story about a baby who got a brain tumor. They still kill people today but if they can remove the entire thing surgically your chances improve somewhat. Henry\u2019s was on his posterior fossa, wrapped snugly around several important cranial nerves. To get it out, his surgeon, Dr. Mallick had to damage these cranial nerves. Thus, the Bell\u2019s palsy and the lazy left eye. The cranial nerve that serves the left ear was severed, so he\u2019s deaf in that ear now. All those things are awful, but they\u2019re really nothing compared to the tracheotomy. The nerves that handle swallowing and gagging were damaged, so Henry can\u2019t prevent saliva from getting into his lungs. You and I swallow about a liter and a half of saliva every day without knowing it. Lose your swallow and you\u2019d get pneumonia pretty quickly, and pneumonia kills people as dead as cancer does.</p><p>Henry\u2019s tracheotomy tube prevents him from speaking, so I haven\u2019t heard him make a peep for over a year. My wife recently walked in on me crying and listening to recordings of him babbling, from before his diagnosis and surgery. I\u2019d recorded his brothers doing Alan Partridge impressions and Henry was in the background, probably playing with the dishwasher, and just talking to himself, in fluent baby. Fucking music, oh my God I want to hear him again. Now he has a foam-cuffed tracheotomy tube in his beautiful throat, rendering him mute. The other day I had to use no small amount of my adult strength to hold him down on a hospital bed while a nurse and a doctor took out his tracheotomy tube, which had broken. It bled like hell because of aggravated scar tissue around the stoma, so I suctioned the blood out of the hole in his throat, while they got ready to put in the replacement tube. It was awful, and Henry was terrified, begging me to pick him up and take him away. But I didn\u2019t. I held him down. The hole in his throat is about the same circumference as a bullet hole. I\u2019ve gotten to know his tracheotomy nurse rather well. She was a colonel in the British Territorial Army and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also helped turn Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children into a triage unit for adults on the day of the bombings in London on July 7th, 2005, which killed 52 people. So even though I fucking hate what she\u2019s taught me to do to my beautiful baby boy\u2019s neck, I\u2019m grateful to have her around to talk me back to sanity afterward.</p><p>I\u2019m aware this ends somewhat abruptly. The above was part of a book proposal I put together before Henry\u2019s tumor came back and we learned that he would die. I stopped writing when we saw the new, bad MRI. My wife and his brothers and I just wanted to be with him around the clock and make sure his final months were happy. And they were.</p><p>The reason I\u2019m putting this out there now is that the intended audience for this book was to be my fellow parents of very sick children. They were always so tired and sad, like ghosts, walking the halls of the hospitals, and I wanted them to know someone understood and cared. I\u2019d still like them to know that, so here these few pages are, for them. Or for you.</p><p>But I can\u2019t write that book anymore because our family\u2019s story has a different ending than I\u2019d hoped for. Maybe I\u2019ll write a different book in the future, but now my responsibility is to my family and myself as we grieve our beautiful Henry.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Family", "Cancer", "Death"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*Wbu-jbJ7Erh6Na_Yxkm4ug.png"], "url": "https://medium.com/@realkniels/how-a-22-day-water-fast-changed-my-life-84b48287144e", "dateCreated": "2018-06-05T14:21:58.270Z", "datePublished": "2018-06-05T14:21:58.270Z", "dateModified": "2020-08-19T15:37:49.772Z", "headline": "How a 22 Day Water Fast Changed My Life - Karin Nielsen - Medium", "name": "How a 22 Day Water Fast Changed My Life - Karin Nielsen - Medium", "description": "Last year, I was trying to come up with novel ways to raise money for MacMillan Cancer who were a huge help to our family when my dad became terminally ill with a rare form of lung cancer.

I was conscious of how desensitised I had become by the sheer volume of charitable requests on my facebook feed and figured I\u2019d have to come up with something radical to make my plea for donations stand out.</p><p>Already aware of the growing trend in intermittent fasting for weight loss, I began to wonder what would happen to my body if I did not eat anything for a prolonged period of time. The more I researched extended water fasting, the more excited I became about its potential to help me raise money and benefit my overall health at the same time.</p><h1>Choosing a goal</h1><p>First I had to settle on a duration to aim for. While most fasting practitioners recommend fasts between 5 and 14 days, I found some detailed accounts of people who had fasted for as long as 45 days and lived to tell the tale. I had a holiday booked and did not want to ruin it so I settled on 22 days as this felt long enough to get some meaningful data. I always think the measure of a goal is how intimidated you feel at the thought of achieving it and this scared the shit out of me so I knew it was ambitious enough.</p><h1>Silencing the naysayers</h1><p>My initial enthusiasm was quickly quashed by well meaning colleagues, friends and family members who tried to talk me out of taking on such a radical challenge.</p><p>\u201cNobody can survive that long without food\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do irreparable damage to your body\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to work\u201d</p><p>By the time I started discussing my plans with other people, I\u2019d done enough research to reassure myself that none of these doomsday prophecies were likely to materialise. Moreover, I trusted that my body would send me warning signals I was heading towards danger at any point.</p><p>Frustrated that water fasting seemed to have such a bad rep I decided to take pre- and post-fast blood tests that would prove unequivocally that I was not permanently damaging my health. This made it easier to field the daily onslaught of concern as I was able to deflect futile debate by reminding people that the results of my post-fast tests would settle the argument once and for all.</p><h1>Monitoring progress</h1><p>I know from experience that doing any kind of \u2018diet\u2019 is close to impossible for me if I am not closely tracking my progress. I was also fascinated by the plethora of claims made about the impact of fasting so I decided to track as much of my experience as possible to motivate myself and help others who consider embarking on a similar journey.</p><h1>Metrics to track</h1><p>There are many parameters you could track and the extent to which you engage with this depends on how inquisitive you are and how much (if anything) you want to spend. I\u2019m very health conscious anyway so I decided to go for the following:</p><ul><li>Blood Vitals (cholesterol, liver function, iron, vitamin D)</li><li>Ketones</li><li>pH Balance</li><li>Body Measurements</li><li>Weight</li><li>Body Fat %</li><li>Muscle Mass %</li><li>Body Water %</li></ul><p>To avoid pestering my GP, I arranged my own blood tests immediately before and after the fast through home health testing startup Thriva.</p><p>I weighed myself using my Withings Bodi Cardio scales every 7 days.</p><p>I measured ketones and pH balance daily using urine test strips to ensure I remained within healthy ranges.</p><p>I took body measurements and pictures of my progress every 7 days.</p><h1>Defining rules for the fast</h1><p>Many purists in the fasting community (yes, that is a thing) will claim that you are not doing it properly unless you drink only filtered water for the duration of the fast. That seemed like a lot of hassle to me and I was not convinced that it would make a big difference so I chose to ignore it. Instead, I decided to allow myself herbal teas and 4tbs of Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar each day. The latter is highly regarded by many fasters as it\u2019s packed with vitamins, minerals and enzymes that help to control your body\u2019s pH levels.</p><h1>Before you start</h1><p>There are lots of excellent and very detailed resources about how best to prepare for an extended water fast (see \u2018Further Reading\u2019 at the end of this post) so I won\u2019t bore you with the detail here. I did not prepare at all as I already restricted my sugar and carbohydrate intake. If you do eat a lot of junk it may be an idea to start with a low sugar/carb diet for a couple of weeks to reduce the withdrawals and minimise the risk of keto flu which is extremely unpleasant. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions whatsoever you should definitely consult your GP before you fast for any period of time.</p><h1>Fasting while living a normal life</h1><p>I\u2019m not a doctor or fasting expert so I\u2018m not here to make claims about what is right and wrong. I can only share my own experience and it\u2019s up to you how you interpret the results.</p><p>A lot of blogs I read recommended getting as much rest as possible and ideally, taking some time off work. This just was not an option for me so I decided to do my fast while going about my normal daily life.</p><p>That means working 12+ hour days, 22km round-trip commutes on my bike and continuing to work out in the gym 2\u20133 times per week. I did reduce cardio intensity to ease the pressure on my heart but was able to lift as much weight as before without noticing much difference in form for the duration of the fast.</p><h1>During the fast</h1><p>Fasting is insanely hard but it does get a lot easier as your body adjusts to the new \u2018normal\u2019.</p><p>During the first three days I felt like I could have fallen off the wagon at any time. The smell of food drove me wild and I started to obsess about all the things I would devour as soon as I could eat again. By the third day I was in full ketosis and experienced pounding headaches, disturbed sleep and felt light headed when standing up too quickly.</p><p>At the two week mark, the uncontrollable hunger pangs and headaches were completely gone. My blood pressure was still lower than usual which explains why I felt light-headed and freezing cold at times. I was able to handle and cook food for my boyfriend without feeling tempted and found the smell of junk and sugar laden snacks repulsive.</p><p>Week three was surprisingly easy compared to weeks one and two. I suspect this is due to the body adjusting to the new \u2018normal\u2019 and the fact that I had purged most of the toxins in my system at this point which is said to significantly reduce unpleasant and flu-like side effects.</p><h1>The results (drum roll please\u2026)</h1><p>Physically and mentally, I felt in the shape of my life.</p><p>Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s take a look at the data:</p><p>As you can see, the results are astonishing. Far from causing irreparable damage to my health, my extended fast had a profound impact on my vital health stats.</p><p>The values highlighted in orange were classified as suboptimal by the good doctors at Thriva. That is to say that while I was not in immediate danger, my pre-fast test results indicated abnormalities that were a cause for concern.</p><p>The values highlighted in green indicate a return to \u2018healthy\u2019 levels in the areas where results were previously in the unhealthy range. Most notably, my liver function and cholesterol bounced right back to well within the healthy zone.</p><p>Naturally, I expected to lose weight on a diet of water and herbal tea but I never expected such wide-ranging improvements across the board.</p><h1>What I learned</h1><p>I embarked on this journey believing that the only positive side effects would be weight loss + money raised for charity. I was wrong!</p><p>Extended fasting is ultimately a test of determination, will power and grit. Completing such a tough personal challenge did not only improve my physical wellbeing but also boosted my self belief and fine tuned my self awareness.</p><p>I now believe that the \u20183 meals per day\u2019 lifestyle we have all become used to is nothing more than a social construct. Our hunter gatherer forefathers did not have the luxury of cornflakes on waking followed by a Boots meal deal at lunch and deliveroo for dinner. I no longer think we \u2018need\u2019 this either.</p><p>6 months on from breaking my fast, I have managed to maintain my post-fast weight (with the exception of a small amount of water gain).

It\u2019s a not-so-smooth criminal that tends to return to the scene of the crime (i.e., your face), if you\u2019ll join us on this true crime metaphor. Face mapping is key to identifying the culprit: while many factors can lead to breakouts, the location on your face can be a revealing clue. Think of pimple face mapping as doing a forensics report at the scene of the crime. Here are some clues to the meaning of pimple locations, and what you can do to solve the case of the reappearing zit.</p><h1>Acne breakouts in the same spot</h1><p>There are a few possible reasons you\u2019d get pimples in the same place over and over again. Acne can come back in the same spot from certain behaviors, such as sitting chin-in-hand while reading or working on your computer, touching your phone to your face when you\u2019re talking on the phone, or putting certain makeup or products on the same area on a regular basis. If you have a habit of picking or squeezing your zits, that will also cause recurring breakouts in that area, because the pimple won\u2019t heal properly and may spread into the surrounding area. Often, a pimple recurs in the exact same spot because there is still inflammation deeper in the skin, which makes the spot vulnerable to the usual acne influencers (i.e., hormones, stress, diet, local irritants, etc.). Using a medicated treatment like your custom Curology superbottle can help with that!</p><h1>Acne on jawline and chin breakouts</h1><p>Pimples popping up on your lower cheek, jawline, and chin is known as a \u201chormonal pattern.\u201d Acne in these areas is often caused by your skin\u2019s oil glands overreacting to hormonal responses, which can be triggered by factors such as stress, eating too much sugar or dairy, or the (perfectly normal) fluctuations that happen during women\u2019s menstrual cycles. Also, women who have a hormonal imbalance due to a condition such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may develop acne in a hormonal pattern.</p><h2>Try this for acne on your chin and jawline</h2><ul><li>Reduce the amount of sugar or dairy in your diet.</li><li>Take a few minutes in the morning or evening to meditate.</li></ul><h1>Why am I breaking out on my neck?</h1><p>Just like on your jawline and chin area, acne on your neck can be caused by your skin\u2019s oil glands overreacting to hormonal responses.</p><p>Learn more about what causes acne, including what foods and other factors can trigger an acne-triggering hormone reaction.</p><h1>Blackheads on nose and nose acne</h1><p>Blackheads are small clogged pores (aka open comedones) that turn black because the trapped oil and skin cells are exposed to the air. People tend to get blackheads on their nose because the skin on and around your nose (aka the T-zone) has a high concentration of oil glands.</p><p>You might try a pore strip once or twice a week, such as Bior\u00e9 Deep Cleansing Pore Strips or Boscia Pore Purifying Charcoal Strips. (We only recommend pore strips for your nose\u2014they can be too harsh for other parts of your face).</p><p>Since your nose might get oilier than other parts of your face, you might not need to apply moisturizer as much there. The ingredients in your custom Curology superbottle can help keep it in balance, too.</p><h1>Acne on cheeks</h1><p>Our cheeks are one of the more common places to break out, and this can happen for a variety of reasons: touching your cheeks, holding your phone against your cheek when you\u2019re talking on the phone, friction or bacteria from the pillow you sleep on (or sleeping on your hand), or wearing makeup on your cheeks, to name a few. However, in most people, there is not a specific reason for acne occurring on the cheeks \u2014 it just happens (sorry)!</p><h2>Try this for cheek acne</h2><ul><li>Wipe down your smartphone weekly.</li><li>Swap out your pillowcases more often.</li></ul><h1>Pimples on forehead</h1><p>Forehead pimples could be caused by hair products, shampoos, and conditioners, so if you\u2019re breaking out there, check your hair products for pore-clogging ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, and coconut oil (aka cocos nucifera oil in many ingredients lists). You can also look up a product on CosDNA.com to get an instant analysis of its ingredients, complete with a rating on the acne-causing and skin-irritating scales. Check out our easy guide: How to know if any makeup or skincare products might cause acne breakouts.</p><p>Another possible cause of forehead bumps is pityrosporum, a type of fungus. Pityrosporum (aka malassezia) is a regular guest on our skin, but too much can be related to seborrheic dermatitis (i.e., dandruff). Dandruff, FYI, can happen on your face as well as your scalp. \ud83d\ude31</p><p>If you\u2019ve got signs of pityrosporum or seborrheic dermatitis clogging your pores with skin flakes, there are some easily accessible treatments. A zinc pyrithione soap or shampoo can help acne along the forehead/hairline, and an over-the-counter ketoconazole shampoo (1%) will help with a flaky, greasy scalp.</p><h2>Try this for forehead acne</h2><ul><li>Avoid touching your forehead.</li><li>Use a zinc pyrithione soap or shampoo.</li></ul><h1>Pimples around your mouth</h1><p>Check your toothpaste for sodium lauryl sulfate and/or sodium laureth sulfate. Some people break out more when their skin comes into contact with toothpaste foam because it\u2019s got those pore-clogging ingredients. Some people might be irritated by whitening agents or fluoride, too. If you\u2019re breaking out around your lips, try switching to an SLS-free and fluoride-free toothpaste for a couple of months \u2014 it might make a difference! Check out brands such as Tom\u2019s of Maine, Sensodyne, and Jason Natural Cosmetics for SLS-free toothpaste options.</p><h1>Consider us the Watson to your Sherlock Holmes</h1><p>Whatever the cause of your acne, your custom Curology superbottle can help you vanquish those villainous whiteheads and blackheads.

Experts say you shouldn\u2019t let your hunger or cravings drive you, but rather go slowly and thoughtfully into what you eat first.</p><p>When to break your fast?</p><p>When you start eating again depends upon the fasting protocol you\u2019ve taken on. If you\u2019re doing time restricted feeding, many people choose to stop eating around 7 or 8pm, fast overnight, skip breakfast, and have their first meal around 11am or 12pm, at lunch essentially. Generally, you don\u2019t want to break a fast at night since you\u2019ll be using fewer calories as you head to bed.</p><p>Go slow</p><p>No matter the kind of fast you\u2019ve done, be it time restricted feeding for some hours, or a water fast for a day or more, it\u2019s most important that you ease back into eating so as not to overwhelm your digestion or undo some of the good effects you\u2019ve achieved by fasting. A loaded cheeseburger might sound fantastic, but it probably won\u2019t feel so good going down.</p><p>One expert recommends you halve the number of days you fasted and used that as a guide for reintroducing foods. So, if you fasted for four days, take two days to ease your way back into eating.</p><p>Consider starting with broths and liquids for the first meal, and possibly the first day, if you\u2019ve been on a longer fast. The less sugar in these liquids, the better, as those can create bloating and digestive irritation. Once you introduce food, expect to gain back a certain amount of water weight due to adding back in some carbs and replenishing your glycogen stores. However, be sure to continue to drink lots of water as well. You might have become dehydrated while fasting, which is common if you don\u2019t stay on top of your fluid intake.</p><p>Post-fasting is also not a great time to experiment with new foods or recipes you haven\u2019t tried before. Your body might not be prepared to properly digest these new foods, so it is best to first reintroduce something that is familiar to you to ease the transition. Wait until you are back into a normal eating routine to start experimenting with new foods.</p><p>Gradually introduce foods</p><p>When you start eating again, choose foods that are low on the glycemic index because too many carbs, especially carbohydrates that are easily digested and quickly absorbed, can spike insulin levels. One fasting expert recommends eggs, avocado, nuts and spinach as good examples to introduce first.</p><p>Another nutrition expert recommends that you start with soft-cooked foods like vegetables, since these are easier to digest. Slowly move up to foods with whole grains and high fiber because too much of these after not eating can lead to constipation. Add in raw foods last, as these can irritate your digestive tract.</p><p>When transitioning off a prolonged fast, it may be better to start with small servings and have no more than 500 calories per meal. This slow transition will help your body adapt to having higher amounts of nutrients again. In rare cases, people who have gone a long time without eating \u2014 usually more than 10 days \u2014 or who are malnourished prior to starting a fast can be at higher risk of a dangerous condition known as \u201crefeeding syndrome.\u201d This is a potentially fatal syndrome that can occur due to shifts in fluids and electrolytes after macronutrients are too rapidly reintroduced into the body. As long as you are in good health going into your fast, transition slowly back to your normal diet and are under the care of a health professional before, during, and after fasting, this is unlikely to occur.</p><p>If you start craving sugar again after a fast and think you\u2019ll quell your sweet tooth with fruit, go carefully, particularly if you are fasting for weight loss or to balance your blood sugar. Even too much natural fructose can negatively impact insulin sensitivity. If you must eat fruit, choose those that are lower on the glycemic index and higher in fiber, such as berries, apples, or pears.</p><p>To help overeating, have a plan in place for breaking your fast. For prolonged fasts, map out your meals for the week after your fast. Knowing what and how much you will be eating the days following your fast will help reduce your risk of binge eating and choosing poor quality foods. Meal planning apps or meal prep kits are great tools to help with this.</p><p>Other considerations</p><p>A small portion of protein at your first meal such as eggs or chicken can be a good option, as they provide essential amino acids to help rebuild and repair the body. When you fast, growth pathways such as IGF-1 and mTOR are suppressed. Amino acids stimulate both of these, so once you reintroduce amino acids from protein sources post fast, you then activate this beneficial growth period.</p><p>What you eat isn\u2019t the only consideration after fasting; another expert recommends you chew your food very thoroughly, as many as 30 times per bite, to make sure your food is easily digested.</p><p>If you\u2019re anxious about digestion, consider adding in a probiotic, either in the form of a supplement or by eating foods that have naturally occurring probiotics in them, such as sauerkraut, miso, and, when you feel ready for dairy, yogurt.</p><p>Beyond just breaking your fast, also consider your overall eating habits. If fasting is your only answer to getting healthier, but you don\u2019t eat well the rest of the time, fasting is unlikely to give you the results you\u2019re seeking.</p>", "tags": ["Health", "Fasting", "Intermittent Fasting", "Nutrition", "Balanced Diet"]}, {"jsonld": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "image": ["https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*4kOJv8hmd5VFPcBL1mywsw.png"], "url": "https://tomaspueyo.medium.com/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca", "dateCreated": "2020-03-10T11:12:45.620Z", "datePublished": "2020-03-10T11:12:45.620Z", "dateModified": "2021-05-05T09:21:23.237Z", "headline": "Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now - Tomas Pueyo - Medium", "name": "Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now - Tomas Pueyo - Medium", "description": "Updated on 3/19/2020.

It\u2019s coming at an exponential speed: gradually, and then suddenly.It\u2019s a matter of days. Maybe a week or two.When it does, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed.Your fellow citizens will be treated in the hallways. Exhausted healthcare workers will break down. Some will die.They will have to decide which patient gets the oxygen and which one dies. The only way to prevent this is social distancing today. Not tomorrow. Today.That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.</p><p>As a politician, community leader or business leader, you have the power and the responsibility to prevent this.</p><p>You might have fears today: What if I overreact? Will people laugh at me? Will they be angry at me? Will I look stupid? Won\u2019t it be better to wait for others to take steps first? Will I hurt the economy too much?</p><p>But in 2\u20134 weeks, when the entire world is in lockdown, when the few precious days of social distancing you will have enabled will have saved lives, people won\u2019t criticize you anymore: They will thank you for making the right decision.</p><p>Ok, let\u2019s do this.</p><h1>1. How Many Cases of Coronavirus Will There Be in Your Area?</h1><h2>Country Growth</h2><p>The total number of cases grew exponentially until China contained it. But then, it leaked outside, and now it\u2019s a pandemic that nobody can stop.</p><p>As of today, this is mostly due to Italy, Iran and South Korea:</p><p>There are so many cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran that it\u2019s hard to see the rest of the countries, but let\u2019s zoom in on that corner at the bottom right.</p><p>There are dozens of countries with exponential growth rates. As of today, most of them are Western.</p><p>If you keep up with that type of growth rate for just a week, this is what you get:</p><p>If you want to understand what will happen, or how to prevent it, you need to look at the cases that have already gone through this: China, Eastern countries with SARS experience, and Italy.</p><h1>China</h1><a>Journal of the American Medical Association</a><p>This is one of the most important charts.</p><p>It shows in orange bars the daily official number of cases in the Hubei province: How many people were diagnosed that day.</p><p>The grey bars show the true daily coronavirus cases. The Chinese CDC found these by asking patients during the diagnostic when their symptoms started.</p><p>Crucially, these true cases weren\u2019t known at the time. We can only figure them out looking backwards: The authorities don\u2019t know that somebody just started having symptoms. They know when somebody goes to the doctor and gets diagnosed.</p><p>What this means is that the orange bars show you what authorities knew, and the grey ones what was really happening.</p><p>On January 21st, the number of new diagnosed cases (orange) is exploding: there are around 100 new cases. In reality, there were 1,500 new cases that day, growing exponentially. But the authorities didn\u2019t know that. What they knew was that suddenly there were 100 new cases of this new illness.</p><p>Two days later, authorities shut down Wuhan. At that point, the number of diagnosed daily new cases was ~400. Note that number: they made a decision to close the city with just 400 new cases in a day. In reality, there were 2,500 new cases that day, but they didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>The day after, another 15 cities in Hubei shut down.</p><p>Up until Jan 23rd, when Wuhan closes, you can look at the grey graph: it\u2019s growing exponentially. True cases were exploding. As soon as Wuhan shuts down, cases slow down. On Jan 24th, when another 15 cities shut down, the number of true cases (again, grey) grinds to a halt. Two days later, the maximum number of true cases was reached, and it has gone down ever since.</p><p>Note that the orange (official) cases were still growing exponentially: For 12 more days, it looked like this thing was still exploding. But it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s just that the cases were getting stronger symptoms and going to the doctor more, and the system to identify them was stronger.</p><p>This concept of official and true cases is important. Let\u2019s keep it in mind for later.</p><p>The rest of regions in China were well coordinated by the central government, so they took immediate and drastic measures. This is the result:</p><p>Every flat line is a Chinese region with coronavirus cases. Each one had the potential to become exponential, but thanks to the measures happening just at the end of January, all of them stopped the virus before it could spread.</p><p>Meanwhile, South Korea, Italy and Iran had a full month to learn, but didn\u2019t. They started the same exponential growth of Hubei and passed every other Chinese region before the end of February.</p><h2>Eastern Countries</h2><p>South Korea cases have exploded, but have you wondered why Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand or Hong Kong haven\u2019t?</p><p>Many of them were hit by SARS in 2003, and all of them learned from it. They learned how viral and lethal it could be, so they knew to take it seriously. That\u2019s why all of their graphs, despite starting to grow much earlier, still don\u2019t look like exponentials.</p><p>So far, we have stories of coronavirus exploding, governments realizing the threat, and containing them. For the rest of the countries, however, it\u2019s a completely different story.</p><p>Before I jump to them, a note about South Korea: The country is probably an outlier. The coronavirus was contained for the first 30 cases. Patient 31 was a super-spreader who passed it to thousands of other people. Because the virus spreads before people show symptoms, by the time the authorities realized the issue, the virus was out there. They\u2019re now paying the consequences of that one instance. Their containment efforts show, however: Italy has already passed it in numbers of cases, and Iran will pass it tomorrow (3/10/2020).</p><h2>Washington State</h2><p>You\u2019ve already seen the growth in Western countries, and how bad forecasts of just one week look like. Now imagine that containment doesn\u2019t happen like in Wuhan or in other Eastern countries, and you get a colossal epidemic.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at a few cases, such as Washington State, the San Francisco Bay Area, Paris and Madrid.</p><p>Washington State is the US\u2019s Wuhan.The number of cases there is growing exponentially. It\u2019s currently at 140.</p><p>But something interesting happened early on. The death rate was through the roof. At some point, the state had 3 cases and one death.</p><p>We know from other places that the death rate of the coronavirus is anything between 0.5% and 5% (more on that later). How could the death rate be 33%?</p><p>It turned out that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks. It\u2019s not like there were only 3 cases. It\u2019s that authorities only knew about 3, and one of them was dead because the more serious the condition, the more likely somebody is to be tested.</p><p>This is a bit like the orange and grey bars in China: Here they only knew about the orange bars (official cases) and they looked good: just 3. But in reality, there were hundreds, maybe thousands of true cases.</p><p>This is an issue: You only know the official cases, not the true ones. But you need to know the true ones. How can you estimate the true ones? It turns out, there\u2019s a couple of ways. And I have a model for both, so you can play with the numbers too (direct link to copy of the model).</p><p>First, through deaths. If you have deaths in your region, you can use that to guess the number of true current cases. We know approximately how long it takes for that person to go from catching the virus to dying on average (17.3 days). That means the person who died on 2/29 in Washington State probably got infected around 2/12.</p><p>Then, you know the mortality rate. For this scenario, I\u2019m using 1% (we\u2019ll discuss later the details). That means that, around 2/12, there were already around ~100 cases in the area (of which only one ended up in death 17.3 days later).</p><p>Now, use the average doubling time for the coronavirus (time it takes to double cases, on average). It\u2019s 6.2. That means that, in the 17 days it took this person to die, the cases had to multiply by ~8 (=2^(17/6)). That means that, if you are not diagnosing all cases, one death today means 800 true cases today.</p><p>Washington state has today 22 deaths. With that quick calculation, you get ~16,000 true coronavirus cases today. As many as the official cases in Italy and Iran combined.</p><p>If we look into the detail, we realize that 19 of these deaths were from one cluster, which might not have spread the virus widely. So if we consider those 19 deaths as one, the total deaths in the state is four. Updating the model with that number, we still get ~3,000 cases today.</p><p>This approach from Trevor Bedford looks at the viruses themselves and their mutations to assess the current case count.</p><p>The conclusion is that there are likely ~1,100 cases in Washington state right now.</p><p>None of these approaches are perfect, but they all point to the same message: We don\u2019t know the number of true cases, but it\u2019s much higher than the official one. It\u2019s not in the hundreds. It\u2019s in the thousands, maybe more.</p><p>San Francisco Bay Area</p><p>Until 3/8, the Bay Area didn\u2019t have any death. That made it hard to know how many true cases there were. Officially, there were 86 cases. But the US is vastly undertesting because it doesn\u2019t have enough kits. The country decided to create their own test kit, which turned out not to work.</p><p>These were the number of tests carried out in different countries by March 3rd:</p><a>Sources for each number here</a><p>Turkey, with no cases of coronavirus, had 10 times the testing per inhabitant than the US. The situation is not much better today, with ~8,000 tests performed in the US, which means ~4,000 people have been tested.</p><p>Here, you can just use a share of official cases to true cases. How to decide which one? For the Bay Area, they were testing everybody who had traveled or was in contact with a traveler, which means that they knew most of the travel-related cases, but none of the community spread cases. By having a sense of community spread vs. travel spread, you can know how many true cases there are.</p><p>I looked at that ratio for South Korea, which has great data. By the time they had 86 cases, the % of them from community spread was 86% (86 and 86% are a coincidence).</p><p>With that number, you can calculate the number of true cases. If the Bay Area has 86 cases today, it is likely that the true number is ~600.</p><h2>France and Paris</h2><p>France claims 1,400 cases today and 30 deaths. Using the two methods above, you can have a range of cases: between 24,000 and 140,000.</p><p>The true number of coronavirus cases in France today is likely to be between 24,000 and 140,000.</p><p>Let me repeat that: the number of true cases in France is likely to be between one and two orders or magnitude higher than it is officially reported.</p><p>Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s look at the Wuhan graph again.</p><a>Journal of the American Medical Association</a><p>If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases. Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases. So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more. If France thinks it has 1,400 cases, it might well have tens of thousands</p><p>The same math applies to Paris. With ~30 cases inside the city, the true number of cases is likely to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With 300 cases in the Ile-de-France region, the total cases in the region might already exceed tens of thousands.</p><h2>Spain and Madrid</h2><p>Spain has very similar numbers as France (1,200 cases vs. 1,400, and both have 30 deaths). That means the same rules are valid: Spain has probably upwards of 20k true cases already.</p><p>In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.</p><p>If you read these data and tell yourself: \u201cImpossible, this can\u2019t be true\u201d, just think this: With this number of cases, Wuhan was already in lockdown.</p><p>With the number of cases we see today in countries like the US, Spain, France, Iran, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland, Wuhan was already in lockdown.</p><p>And if you\u2019re telling yourself: \u201cWell, Hubei is just one region\u201d, let me remind you that it has nearly 60 million people, bigger than Spain and about the size of France.</p><h1>2. What Will Happen When These Coronavirus Cases Materialize?</h1><p>So the coronavirus is already here. It\u2019s hidden, and it\u2019s growing exponentially.</p><p>What will happen in our countries when it hits? It\u2019s easy to know, because we already have several places where it\u2019s happening. The best examples are Hubei and Italy.</p><h2>Fatality Rates</h2><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) quotes 3.4% as the fatality rate (% people who contract the coronavirus and then die). This number is out of context so let me explain it.</p><p>It really depends on the country and the moment: between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran. So what is it? We can use a trick to figure it out.</p><p>The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases. The first one is likely to be an underestimate, because lots of open cases can still end up in death. The second is an overestimate, because it\u2019s likely that deaths are closed quicker than recoveries.</p><p>What I did was look at how both evolve over time. Both of these numbers will converge to the same result once all cases are closed, so if you project past trends to the future, you can make a guess on what the final fatality rate will be.</p><p>This is what you see in the data. China\u2019s fatality rate is now between 3.6% and 6.1%. If you project that in the future, it looks like it converges towards ~3.8%-4%. This is double the current estimate, and 30 times worse than the flu.</p><p>It is made up of two completely different realities though: Hubei and the rest of China.</p><p>Hubei\u2019s fatality rate will probably converge towards 4.8%. Meanwhile, for the rest of China, it will likely converge to ~0.9%:</p><p>I also charted the numbers for Iran, Italy and South Korea, the only countries with enough deaths to make this somewhat relevant.</p><p>Iran\u2019s and Italy\u2019s Deaths / Total Cases are both converging towards the 3%-4% range. My guess is their numbers will end up around that figure too.</p><p>South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that a few unique things are happening there. First, they\u2019re testing everybody (with so many open cases, the death rate seems low), and leaving the cases open for longer (so they close cases quickly when the patient is dead). Second, they have a lot of hospital beds (see chart 17.b). There might also be other reasons we don\u2019t know. What is relevant is that deaths/cases has hovered around 0.5% since the beginning, suggesting it will stay there, likely heavily influenced by the healthcare system and crisis management.</p><p>The last relevant example is the Diamond Princess cruise: with 706 cases, 6 deaths and 100 recoveries, the fatality rate will be between 1% and 6.5%.</p><p>Note that the age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, countries with an aging population like Japan will be harder hit on average than younger countries like Nigeria. There are also weather factors, especially humidity and temperature, but it\u2019s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.</p><p>This is what you can conclude:</p><ul><li>Excluding these, countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of ~0.5% (South Korea) to 0.9% (rest of China).</li><li>Countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%</li></ul><p>Put in another way: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a factor of ten. And that\u2019s just counting the fatality rate. Acting fast also drastically reduces the cases, making this even more of a no-brainer.</p><p>Countries that act fast reduce the number of deaths at least by 10x.</p><p>So what does a country need to be prepared?</p><h2>What Will Be the Pressure on the System</h2><p>Around 20% of cases require hospitalization, 5% of cases require the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and around 2.5% require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO (extra-corporeal oxygenation).</p><p>The problem is that items such as ventilators and ECMO can\u2019t be produced or bought easily. A few years ago, the US had a total of 250 ECMO machines, for example.</p><p>So if you suddenly have 100,000 people infected, many of them will want to go get tested. Around 20,000 will require hospitalization, 5,000 will need the ICU, and 1,000 will need machines that we don\u2019t have enough of today. And that\u2019s just with 100,000 cases.</p><p>That is without taking into account issues such as masks. A country like the US has only 1% of the masks it needs to cover the needs of its healthcare workers (12M N95, 30M surgical vs. 3.5B needed). If a lot of cases appear at once, there will be masks for only 2 weeks.</p><p>Countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong or Singapore, as well as Chinese regions outside of Hubei, have been prepared and given the care that patients need.</p><p>But the rest of Western countries are rather going in the direction of Hubei and Italy. So what is happening there?</p><h2>What an Overwhelmed Healthcare System Looks Like</h2><p>The stories that happened in Hubei and those in Italy are starting to become eerily similar. Hubei built two hospitals in ten days, but even then, it was completely overwhelmed.</p><p>Both complained that patients inundated their hospitals. They had to be taken care of anywhere: in hallways, in waiting rooms\u2026</p><a>Medico Humanitas su Facebook: \"Situazione drammatica, altro che normale influenza\"Pubblichiamo l'intervento sui social di Daniele Macchini, medico alle Cliniche Humanitas Gavazzeni. Una testimonianza\u2026bergamo.corriere.it</a><p>Healthcare workers spend hours in a single piece of protective gear, because there\u2019s not enough of them. As a result, they can\u2019t leave the infected areas for hours. When they do, they crumble, dehydrated and exhausted. Shifts don\u2019t exist anymore. People are driven back from retirement to cover needs. People who have no idea about nursing are trained overnight to fulfill critical roles. Everybody is on call, always.</p><a>Francesca Mangiatordi</a><p>That is, until they become sick. Which happens a lot, because they\u2019re in constant exposure to the virus, without enough protective gear. When that happens, they need to be in quarantine for 14 days, during which they can\u2019t help. Best case scenario, 2 weeks are lost. Worst case, they\u2019re dead.</p><p>The worst is in the ICUs, when patients need to share ventilators or ECMOs. These are in fact impossible to share, so the healthcare workers must determine what patient will use it. That really means, which one lives and which one dies.</p><a>Coronavirus: 'We must choose who to treat,' says Italian doctorAn Italian doctor in Lombardy, a region of Italy that has been quarantined due to the new coronavirus (Covid-19)\u2026www.brusselstimes.com</a><p>\u201cAfter a few days, we have to choose.

If you want your city or your country to be part of the 4%, don\u2019t do anything today.</p><a>The Guardian</a><a>The New York Times</a><h1>3. What Should You Do?</h1><h2>Flatten the Curve</h2><p>This is a pandemic now. It can\u2019t be eliminated. But what we can do is reduce its impact.</p><p>Some countries have been exemplary at this. The best one is Taiwan, which is extremely connected with China and yet still has as of today fewer than 50 cases. This recent paper explain all the measures they took early on, which were focused on containment.</p><a>Response to COVID-19 in Taiwan: Big Data Analytics, New Technology, and Proactive TestingThis Viewpoint describes the outbreak response infrastructure developed by the Taiwanese government following the SARS\u2026jamanetwork.com</a><p>They have been able to contain it, but most countries lacked this expertise and didn\u2019t. Now, they\u2019re playing a different game: mitigation. They need to make this virus as inoffensive as possible.</p><p>If we reduce the infections as much as possible, our healthcare system will be able to handle cases much better, driving the fatality rate down. And, if we spread this over time, we will reach a point where the rest of society can be vaccinated, eliminating the risk altogether. So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It\u2019s to postpone them.</p><a>Source</a><p>The more we postpone cases, the better the healthcare system can function, the lower the mortality rate, and the higher the share of the population that will be vaccinated before it gets infected.</p><p>How do we flatten the curve?</p><h2>Social Distancing</h2><p>There is one very simple thing that we can do and that works: social distancing.</p><p>If you go back to the Wuhan graph, you will remember that as soon as there was a lockdown, cases went down. That\u2019s because people didn\u2019t interact with each other, and the virus didn\u2019t spread.</p><p>The current scientific consensus is that this virus can be spread within 2 meters (6 feet) if somebody coughs. Otherwise, the droplets fall to the ground and don\u2019t infect you.</p><p>The worst infection then becomes through surfaces: The virus survives for up to 9 days on different surfaces such as metal, ceramics and plastics. That means things like doorknobs, tables, or elevator buttons can be terrible infection vectors.</p><p>The only way to truly reduce that is with social distancing: Keeping people home as much as possible, for as long as possible until this recedes.</p><p>This has already been proven in the past. Namely, in the 1918 flu pandemic.</p><h2>Learnings from the 1918 Flu Pandemic</h2><p>You can see how Philadelphia didn\u2019t act quickly, and had a massive peak in death rates. Compare that with St Louis, which did.</p><p>Then look at Denver, which enacted measures and then loosened them. They had a double peak, with the 2nd one higher than the first.</p><p>If you generalize, this is what you find:</p><p>This chart shows, for the 1918 flu in the US, how many more deaths there were per city depending on how fast measures were taken. For example, a city like St Louis took measures 6 days before Pittsburgh, and had less than half the deaths per citizen. On average, taking measures 20 days earlier halved the death rate.</p><p>Italy has finally figured this out. They first locked down Lombardy on Sunday, and one day later, on Monday, they realized their mistake and decided they had to lock down the entire country.</p><p>Hopefully, we will see results in the coming days. However, it will take one to two weeks to see. Remember the Wuhan graph: there was a delay of 12 days between the moment when the lockdown was announced and the moment when official cases (orange) started going down.</p><h2>How Can Politicians Contribute to Social Distancing?</h2><p>The question politicians are asking themselves today is not whether they should do something, but rather what\u2019s the appropriate action to take.</p><p>There are several stages to control an epidemic, starting with anticipation and ending with eradication. But it\u2019s too late for most options today. With this level of cases, the only options politicians have in front of them are containment, mitigation or suppression.</p><p>Containment</p><p>Containment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It\u2019s what Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them\u2026 This works extremely well when you\u2019re prepared and you do it early on, and don\u2019t need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen.</p><p>I\u2019ve already touted Taiwan\u2019s approach. But China\u2019s is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That\u2019s how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.</p><p>This is not what Western countries have done. And now it\u2019s too late. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it\u2019s enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban.</p><a>Link to source</a><p>This chart shows the impact that the Wuhan travel ban had delaying the epidemic. The bubble sizes show the number of daily cases. The top line shows the cases if nothing is done. The two other lines show the impact if 40% and 90% of travel is eliminated. This is a model created by epidemiologists, because we can\u2019t know for sure.</p><p>If you don\u2019t see much difference, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s very hard to see any change in the development of the epidemic.</p><p>Researchers estimate that, all in all, the Wuhan travel ban only delayed the spread in China by 3\u20135 days.</p><p>Now what did researchers think the impact of reducing transmission would be?</p><p>The top bloc is the same as the one you\u2019ve seen before. The two other blocks show decreasing transmission rates. If the transmission rate goes down by 25% (through Social Distancing), it flattens the curve and delays the peak by a whole 14 weeks. Lower the transition rate by 50%, and you can\u2019t see the epidemic even starting within a quarter.</p><p>The US administration\u2019s ban on European travel is good: It has probably bought us a few hours, maybe a day or two. But not more. It is not enough. It\u2019s containment when what\u2019s needed is mitigation.</p><p>Once there are hundreds or thousands of cases growing in the population, preventing more from coming, tracking the existing ones and isolating their contacts isn\u2019t enough anymore. The next level is mitigation or suppression.</p><p>Mitigation or Suppression</p><p>The new article, Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance, covers mitigation vs. suppression at length.</p><p>Mitigation requires a heavy amount of testing, contact tracing, quarantines and isolations to flatten the curve without stopping the outbreak</p><p>Suppression tries to go one step further and quench the outbreak. It requires heavy social distancing. People need to stop hanging out to drop the transmission rate (R), from the R=~2\u20133 that the virus follows without measures, to below 1, so that it eventually dies out.</p><p>These measures require closing companies, shops, mass transit, schools, enforcing lockdowns\u2026 The worse your situation, the worse the social distancing. The earlier you impose heavy measures, the less time you need to keep them, the easier it is to identify brewing cases, and the fewer people get infected.</p><p>This is what Wuhan had to do. This is what Italy was forced to accept. And then France, Spain, and many other countries. Because when the virus is rampant, the only measure is to lock down all the infected areas to stop spreading it at once.</p><p>With thousands of official cases \u2014 and tens of thousands of true ones \u2014 this is what countries like the US, the UK, Germany, Netherlands or Switzerland need to do.</p><p>But they\u2019re not doing it.</p><p>Some businesses are working from home, which is fantastic.Some mass events are being stopped.Some affected areas are quarantining themselves.</p><p>All these measures will slow down the virus. They will lower the transmission rate from 2.5 to 2.2, maybe 2. Hopefully more. But they aren\u2019t enough to get us below 1 for a sustained period of time to stop the epidemic.</p><p>So the question becomes: What are the tradeoffs we could be making to lower the R? This is the menu that Italy has put in front of all of us:</p><ul><li>Nobody can enter or exit lockdown areas, unless there are proven family or work reasons.</li><li>Movement inside the areas is to be avoided, unless they are justified for urgent personal or work reasons and can\u2019t be postponed.</li><li>People with symptoms (respiratory infection and fever) are \u201chighly recommended\u201d to remain home.</li><li>Standard time off for healthcare workers is suspended</li><li>Closure of all educational establishments (schools, universities\u2026), gyms, museums, ski stations, cultural and social centers, swimming pools, and theaters.</li><li>Bars and restaurants have limited opening times from 6am to 6pm, with at least one meter (~3 feet) distance between people.</li><li>All pubs and clubs must close.</li><li>All commercial activity must keep a distance of one meter between customers. Those that can\u2019t make it happen must close. Temples can remain open as long as they can guarantee this distance.</li><li>Family and friends hospital visits are limited</li><li>Work meetings must be postponed. Work from home must be encouraged.</li><li>All sports events and competitions, public or private, are canceled. Important events can be held under closed doors.</li></ul><p>Then two days later, they added: No, in fact, you need to close all businesses that aren\u2019t crucial. So now we\u2019re closing all commercial activities, offices, cafes and shops. Only transportation, pharmacies, groceries will remain open.\u201d</p><p>How to pick the right measures for your country? Read Coronavirus: The Hammer and the Dance. One approach is to gradually increase measures. Unfortunately, that gives precious time for the virus to spread. If you want to be safe, do it Wuhan style. People might complain now, but they\u2019ll thank you later.</p><h2>How Can Business Leaders Contribute to Social Distancing?</h2><p>If you\u2019re a business leader and you want to know what you should do, the best resource for you is Staying Home Club.</p><a>Who's staying home because of COVID-19?A list of all the companies WFH or events changed because of covid-19stayinghome.club</a><p>It is a list of social distancing policies that have been enacted by US tech companies\u2014so far, 328.</p><p>They range from allowed to required Work From Home, and restricted visits, travel, or events.</p><p>There are more things that every company must determine, such as what to do with hourly workers, whether to keep the office open or not, how to conduct interviews, what to do with the cafeterias\u2026 If you want to know how my company, Course Hero, handled some of these, along with a model announcement to your employees, here is the one my company used (view only version here).</p><h1>4. When?</h1><p>It is very possible that so far you\u2019ve agreed with everything I\u2019ve said, and were just wondering since the beginning when to make each decision. Put in another way, what triggers should we have for each measure.</p><h2>Risk-Based Model for Triggers</h2><p>To solve this, I\u2019ve created a model (direct link to copy).</p><a>Coronavirus - When Should You Close Your Office?How To Use Coronavirus Work From Home Model This model should help you and your company make a decision on whether you\u2026docs.google.com</a><p>It enables you to assess the likely number of cases in your area, the probability that your employees are already infected, how that evolves over time, and how that should tell you whether to remain open.</p><p>It tells us things like:</p><ul><li>If your company had 100 employees in the Washington state area, which had 11 coronavirus deaths on 3/8, there was a 25% chance at least one of your employees was infected, and you should have closed immediately.</li><li>If your company had 250 employees mostly in the South Bay (San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, which together had 22 official cases on 3/8 and the true number was probably at least 54), by 3/9 you would have had ~2% chances to have at least one employee infected, and you should have closed your office too.</li><li>[Updated as of 3/12] If your company is in Paris (intramuros), and it has 250 employees, today there\u2019s a 95% chance that one of your employees has the coronavirus, and you should close your office by tomorrow.</li></ul><p>The model uses labels such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d, but the same model can be used for anything else: schools, mass transit\u2026 So if you have only 50 employees in Paris, but all of them are going to take the train, coming across thousands of other people, suddenly the likelihood that at least one of them will get infected is much higher and you should close your office immediately.</p><p>If you\u2019re still hesitating because nobody is showing symptoms, just realize 26% of contagions happen before there are symptoms.</p><h2>Are You Part of a Group of Leaders?</h2><p>This math is selfish. It looks at every company\u2019s risk individually, taking as much risk as we want until the inevitable hammer of the coronavirus closes our offices.</p><p>But if you\u2019re part of a league of business leaders or politicians, your calculations are not for just one company, but for the whole. The math becomes: What\u2019s the likelihood that any of our companies is infected? If you\u2019re a group of 50 companies of 250 employees on average, in the SF Bay Area, there\u2019s a 35% chance that at least one of the companies has an employee infected, and 97% chance that will be true next week. I added a tab in the model to play with that.</p><h1>Conclusion: The Cost of Waiting</h1><p>It might feel scary to make a decision today, but you shouldn\u2019t think about it this way.</p><p>This theoretical model shows different communities: one doesn\u2019t take social distancing measures, one takes them on Day n of an outbreak, the other one on Day n+1. All the numbers are completely fictitious (I chose them to resemble what happened in Hubei, with ~6k daily new cases at the worst). They\u2019re just there to illustrate how important a single day can be in something that grows exponentially. You can see that the one-day delay peaks later and higher, but then daily cases converge to zero.</p><p>But what about cumulative cases?</p><p>In this theoretical model that resembles loosely Hubei, waiting one more day creates 40% more cases! So, maybe, if the Hubei authorities had declared the lockdown on 1/22 instead of 1/23, they might have reduced the number of cases by a staggering 20k.</p><p>And remember, these are just cases. Mortality would be much higher, because not only would there be directly 40% more deaths. There would also be a much higher collapse of the healthcare system, leading to a mortality rate up to 10x higher as we saw before. So a one-day difference in social distancing measures can end exploding the number of deaths in your community by multiplying more cases and higher fatality rate.</p><p>This is an exponential threat. Every day counts. When you\u2019re delaying by a single day a decision, you\u2019re not contributing to a few cases maybe. There are probably hundreds or thousands of cases in your community already. Every day that there isn\u2019t social distancing, these cases grow exponentially.</p><h1>Share the Word</h1><p>This is probably the one time in the last decade that sharing an article might save lives.

If we don\u2019t take these measures, tens of millions will be infected, many will die, along with anybody else that requires intensive care, because the healthcare system will have collapsed.</p><p>Within a week, countries around the world have gone from: \u201cThis coronavirus thing is not a big deal\u201d to declaring the state of emergency. Yet many countries are still not doing much. Why?</p><p>Every country is asking the same question: How should we respond? The answer is not obvious to them.</p><p>Some countries, like France, Spain or Philippines, have since ordered heavy lockdowns. Others, like the US, UK, or Switzerland, have dragged their feet, hesitantly venturing into social distancing measures.</p><p>Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to cover today, again with lots of charts, data and models with plenty of sources:</p><ol><li>What\u2019s the current situation?</li><li>What options do we have?</li><li>What\u2019s the one thing that matters now: Time</li><li>What does a good coronavirus strategy look like?</li><li>How should we think about the economic and social impacts?</li></ol><p>When you\u2019re done reading the article, this is what you\u2019ll take away:</p><p>Our healthcare system is already collapsing.Countries have two options: either they fight it hard now, or they will suffer a massive epidemic.If they choose the epidemic, hundreds of thousands will die. In some countries, millions.And that might not even eliminate further waves of infections.If we fight hard now, we will curb the deaths.We will relieve our healthcare system.We will prepare better.We will learn.The world has never learned as fast about anything, ever.And we need it, because we know so little about this virus.All of this will achieve something critical: Buy Us Time.</p><p>If we choose to fight hard, the fight will be sudden, then gradual.We will be locked in for weeks, not months.Then, we will get more and more freedoms back.It might not be back to normal immediately. But it will be close, and eventually back to normal.And we can do all that while considering the rest of the economy too.</p><p>Ok, let\u2019s do this.</p><h1>1. What\u2019s the situation?</h1><p>Last week, I showed this curve:</p><p>It showed coronavirus cases across the world outside of China. We could only discern Italy, Iran and South Korea. So I had to zoom in on the bottom right corner to see the emerging countries. My entire point is that they would soon be joining these 3 cases.</p><p>Let\u2019s see what has happened since.</p><p>As predicted, the number of cases has exploded in dozens of countries. Here, I was forced to show only countries with over 1,000 cases. A few things to note:</p><ul><li>Spain, Germany, France and the US all have more cases than Italy when it ordered the lockdown</li><li>An additional 16 countries have more cases today than Hubei when it went under lockdown: Japan, Malaysia, Canada, Portugal, Australia, Czechia, Brazil and Qatar have more than Hubei but below 1,000 cases. Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark all have above 1,000 cases.</li></ul><p>Do you notice something weird about this list of countries? Outside of China and Iran, which have suffered massive, undeniable outbreaks, and Brazil and Malaysia, every single country in this list is among the wealthiest in the world.</p><p>Do you think this virus targets rich countries? Or is it more likely that rich countries are better able to identify the virus?</p><p>It\u2019s unlikely that poorer countries aren\u2019t touched. Warm and humid weather probably helps, but doesn\u2019t prevent an outbreak by itself \u2014 otherwise Singapore, Malaysia or Brazil wouldn\u2019t be suffering outbreaks.</p><p>The most likely interpretations are that the coronavirus either took longer to reach these countries because they\u2019re less connected, or it\u2019s already there but these countries haven\u2019t been able to invest enough on testing to know.</p><p>Either way, if this is true, it means that most countries won\u2019t escape the coronavirus. It\u2019s a matter of time before they see outbreaks and need to take measures.</p><p>What measures can different countries take?</p><h1>2. What Are Our Options?</h1><p>Since the article last week, the conversation has changed and many countries have taken measures. Here are some of the most illustrative examples:</p><h2>Measures in Spain and France</h2><p>In one extreme, we have Spain and France. This is the timeline of measures for Spain:</p><p>On Thursday, 3/12, the President dismissed suggestions that the Spanish authorities had been underestimating the health threat.On Friday, they declared the State of Emergency.On Saturday, measures were taken:</p><ul><li>People can\u2019t leave home except for key reasons: groceries, work, pharmacy, hospital, bank or insurance company (extreme justification)</li><li>Specific ban on taking kids out for a walk or seeing friends or family (except to take care of people who need help, but with hygiene and physical distance measures)</li><li>All bars and restaurants closed. Only take-home acceptable.</li><li>All entertainment closed: sports, movies, museums, municipal celebrations\u2026</li><li>Weddings can\u2019t have guests. Funerals can\u2019t have more than a handful of people.</li><li>Mass transit remains open</li></ul><p>On Monday, land borders were shut.</p><p>Some people see this as a great list of measures. Others put their hands up in the air and cry of despair. This difference is what this article will try to reconcile.</p><p>France\u2019s timeline of measures is similar, except they took more time to apply them, and they are more aggressive now. For example, rent, taxes and utilities are suspended for small businesses.</p><h2>Measures in the US and UK</h2><p>The US and UK, like countries such as Switzerland, have dragged their feet in implementing measures. Here\u2019s the timeline for the US:</p><ul><li>Wednesday 3/11: travel ban.</li><li>Friday: National Emergency declared. No social distancing measures</li><li>Monday: the government urges the public to avoid restaurants or bars and attend events with more than 10 people. No social distancing measure is actually enforceable. It\u2019s just a suggestion.</li></ul><p>Lots of states and cities are taking the initiative and mandating much stricter measures.</p><p>The UK has seen a similar set of measures: lots of recommendations, but very few mandates.</p><p>These two groups of countries illustrate the two extreme approaches to fight the coronavirus: mitigation and suppression. Let\u2019s understand what they mean.</p><h2>Option 1: Do Nothing</h2><p>Before we do that, let\u2019s see what doing nothing would entail for a country like the US:</p><a>fantastic epidemic calculator</a><a>previous article</a><a>gathering of research</a><p>If we do nothing: Everybody gets infected, the healthcare system gets overwhelmed, the mortality explodes, and ~10 million people die (blue bars). For the back-of-the-envelope numbers: if ~75% of Americans get infected and 4% die, that\u2019s 10 million deaths, or around 25 times the number of US deaths in World War II.</p><p>You might wonder: \u201cThat sounds like a lot. I\u2019ve heard much less than that!\u201d</p><p>So what\u2019s the catch? With all these numbers, it\u2019s easy to get confused. But there\u2019s only two numbers that matter: What share of people will catch the virus and fall sick, and what share of them will die. If only 25% are sick (because the others have the virus but don\u2019t have symptoms so aren\u2019t counted as cases), and the fatality rate is 0.6% instead of 4%, you end up with 500k deaths in the US.</p><p>If we don\u2019t do anything, the number of deaths from the coronavirus will probably land between these two numbers. The chasm between these extremes is mostly driven by the fatality rate, so understanding it better is crucial. What really causes the coronavirus deaths?</p><h2>How Should We Think about the Fatality Rate?</h2><p>This is the same graph as before, but now looking at hospitalized people instead of infected and dead:</p><p>The light blue area is the number of people who would need to go to the hospital, and the darker blue represents those who need to go to the intensive care unit (ICU). You can see that number would peak at above 3 million.</p><p>Now compare that to the number of ICU beds we have in the US (50k today, we could double that repurposing other space). That\u2019s the red dotted line.</p><p>No, that\u2019s not an error.</p><p>That red dotted line is the capacity we have of ICU beds. Everyone above that line would be in critical condition but wouldn\u2019t be able to access the care they need, and would likely die.</p><p>Instead of ICU beds you can also look at ventilators, but the result is broadly the same, since there are fewer than 100k ventilators in the US.</p><p>This is why people died in droves in Hubei and are now dying in droves in Italy and Iran. The Hubei fatality rate ended up better than it could have been because they built 2 hospitals nearly overnight. Italy and Iran can\u2019t do the same; few, if any, other countries can. We\u2019ll see what ends up happening there.</p><p>So why is the fatality rate close to 4%?</p><p>If 5% of your cases require intensive care and you can\u2019t provide it, most of those people die. As simple as that.</p><p>Additionally, recent data suggests that US cases are more severe than in China.</p><p>I wish that was all, but it isn\u2019t.</p><h2>Collateral Damage</h2><p>These numbers only show people dying from coronavirus. But what happens if all your healthcare system is collapsed by coronavirus patients? Others also die from other ailments.</p><p>What happens if you have a heart attack but the ambulance takes 50 minutes to come instead of 8 (too many coronavirus cases) and once you arrive, there\u2019s no ICU and no doctor available? You die.</p><p>There are 4 million admissions to the ICU in the US every year, and 500k (~13%) of them die. Without ICU beds, that share would likely go much closer to 80%. Even if only 50% died, in a year-long epidemic you go from 500k deaths a year to 2M, so you\u2019re adding 1.5M deaths, just with collateral damage.</p><p>If the coronavirus is left to spread, the US healthcare system will collapse, and the deaths will be in the millions, maybe more than 10 million.</p><p>The same thinking is true for most countries. The number of ICU beds and ventilators and healthcare workers are usually similar to the US or lower in most countries. Unbridled coronavirus means healthcare system collapse, and that means mass death.</p><p>Unbridled coronavirus means healthcare systems collapse, and that means mass death.</p><p>By now, I hope it\u2019s pretty clear we should act. The two options that we have are mitigation and suppression. Both of them propose to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d, but they go about it very differently.</p><h2>Option 2: Mitigation Strategy</h2><p>Mitigation goes like this: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to prevent the coronavirus now, so let\u2019s just have it run its course, while trying to reduce the peak of infections. Let\u2019s just flatten the curve a little bit to make it more manageable for the healthcare system.\u201d</p><p>This chart appears in a very important paper published over the weekend from the Imperial College London. Apparently, it pushed the UK and US governments to change course.</p><p>It\u2019s a very similar graph as the previous one. Not the same, but conceptually equivalent. Here, the \u201cDo Nothing\u201d situation is the black curve. Each one of the other curves are what would happen if we implemented tougher and tougher social distancing measures. The blue one shows the toughest social distancing measures: isolating infected people, quarantining people who might be infected, and secluding old people. This blue line is broadly the current UK coronavirus strategy, although for now they\u2019re just suggesting it, not mandating it.</p><p>Here, again, the red line is the capacity for ICUs, this time in the UK. Again, that line is very close to the bottom. All that area of the curve on top of that red line represents coronavirus patients who would mostly die because of the lack of ICU resources.</p><p>Not only that, but by flattening the curve, the ICUs will collapse for months, increasing collateral damage.</p><p>You should be shocked. When you hear: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do some mitigation\u201d what they\u2019re really saying is: \u201cWe will knowingly overwhelm the healthcare system, driving the fatality rate up by a factor of 10x at least.\u201d</p><p>You would imagine this is bad enough. But we\u2019re not done yet. Because one of the key assumptions of this strategy is what\u2019s called \u201cHerd Immunity\u201d.</p><h2>Herd Immunity and Virus Mutation</h2><p>The idea is that all the people who are infected and then recover are now immune to the virus. This is at the core of this strategy: \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s going to be hard for some time, but once we\u2019re done and a few million people die, the rest of us will be immune to it, so this virus will stop spreading and we\u2019ll say goodbye to the coronavirus. Better do it at once and be done with it, because our alternative is to do social distancing for up to a year and risk having this peak happen later anyways.\u201d</p><p>Except this assumes one thing: the virus doesn\u2019t change too much. If it doesn\u2019t change much, then lots of people do get immunity, and at some point the epidemic dies down</p><p>How likely is this virus to mutate? It seems it already has.</p><p>This graph represents the different mutations of the virus. You can see that the initial strains started in purple in China and then spread. Each time you see a branching on the left graph, that is a mutation leading to a slightly different variant of the virus.</p><p>This should not be surprising: RNA-based viruses like the coronavirus or the flu tend to mutate around 100 times faster than DNA-based ones\u2014although the coronavirus mutates more slowly than influenza viruses.</p><p>Not only that, but the best way for this virus to mutate is to have millions of opportunities to do so, which is exactly what a mitigation strategy would provide: hundreds of millions of people infected.</p><p>That\u2019s why you have to get a flu shot every year. Because there are so many flu strains, with new ones always evolving, the flu shot can never protect against all strains.</p><p>Put in another way: the mitigation strategy not only assumes millions of deaths for a country like the US or the UK. It also gambles on the fact that the virus won\u2019t mutate too much \u2014 which we know it does. And it will give it the opportunity to mutate. So once we\u2019re done with a few million deaths, we could be ready for a few million more \u2014 every year. This corona virus could become a recurring fact of life, like the flu, but many times deadlier.</p><p>The best way for this virus to mutate is to have millions of opportunities to do so, which is exactly what a mitigation strategy would provide.</p><p>So if neither doing nothing nor mitigation will work, what\u2019s the alternative? It\u2019s called suppression.</p><h2>Option 3: Suppression Strategy</h2><p>The Mitigation Strategy doesn\u2019t try to contain the epidemic, just flatten the curve a bit. Meanwhile, the Suppression Strategy tries to apply heavy measures to quickly get the epidemic under control. Specifically:</p><ul><li>Go hard right now. Order heavy social distancing. Get this thing under control.</li><li>Then, release the measures, so that people can gradually get back their freedoms and something approaching normal social and economic life can resume.</li></ul><p>What does that look like?</p><p>Under a suppression strategy, after the first wave is done, the death toll is in the thousands, and not in the millions.</p><p>Why? Because not only do we cut the exponential growth of cases, we also cut the fatality rate since the healthcare system is not completely overwhelmed. Here, I used a fatality rate of 0.9%, around what we\u2019re seeing in South Korea today, which has been most effective at following Suppression Strategy.</p><p>Said like this, it sounds like a no-brainer. Everybody should follow the Suppression Strategy.</p><p>So why do some governments hesitate?</p><p>They fear three things:</p><ol><li>This first lockdown will last for months, which seems unacceptable for many people.</li><li>A months-long lockdown would destroy the economy.</li><li>It wouldn\u2019t even solve the problem, because we would be just postponing the epidemic: later on, once we release the social distancing measures, people will still get infected in the millions and die.</li></ol><p>Here is how the Imperial College team modeled suppressions. The green and yellow lines are different scenarios of Suppression. You can see that doesn\u2019t look good: We still get huge peaks, so why bother?</p><p>We\u2019ll get to these questions in a moment, but there\u2019s something more important before.</p><p>This is completely missing the point.</p><p>Presented like these, the two options of Mitigation and Suppression, side by side, don\u2019t look very appealing. Either a lot of people die soon and we don\u2019t hurt the economy today, or we hurt the economy today, just to postpone the deaths.</p><p>This ignores the value of time.</p><h1>3. The Value of Time</h1><p>In our previous post, we explained the value of time in saving lives. Every day, every hour we waited to take measures, this exponential threat continued spreading. We saw how a single day could reduce the total cases by 40% and the death toll by even more.</p><p>But time is even more valuable than that.</p><p>We\u2019re about to face the biggest wave of pressure on the healthcare system ever seen in history. We are completely unprepared, facing an enemy we don\u2019t know. That is not a good position for war.</p><p>What if you were about to face your worst enemy, of which you knew very little, and you had two options: Either you run towards it, or you escape to buy yourself a bit of time to prepare. Which one would you choose?</p><p>This is what we need to do today. The world has awakened. Every single day we delay the coronavirus, we can get better prepared. The next sections detail what that time would buy us:</p><h2>Lower the Number of Cases</h2><p>With effective suppression, the number of true cases would plummet overnight, as we saw in Hubei last week.</p><a>Journal of the American Medical Association</a><p>As of today, there are 0 daily new cases of coronavirus in the entire 60 million-big region of Hubei.</p><p>The diagnostics would keep going up for a couple of weeks, but then they would start going down. With fewer cases, the fatality rate starts dropping too. And the collateral damage is also reduced: fewer people would die from non-coronavirus-related causes because the healthcare system is simply overwhelmed.</p><p>Suppression would get us:</p><ul><li>Fewer total cases of Coronavirus</li><li>Immediate relief for the healthcare system and the humans who run it</li><li>Reduction in fatality rate</li><li>Reduction in collateral damage</li><li>Ability for infected, isolated and quarantined healthcare workers to get better and back to work. In Italy, healthcare workers represent 8% of all contagions.</li></ul><h2>Understand the True Problem: Testing and Tracing</h2><p>Right now, the UK and the US have no idea about their true cases. We don\u2019t know how many there are. We just know the official number is not right, and the true one is in the tens of thousands of cases. This has happened because we\u2019re not testing, and we\u2019re not tracing.</p><ul><li>With a few more weeks, we could get our testing situation in order, and start testing everybody. With that information, we would finally know the true extent of the problem, where we need to be more aggressive, and what communities are safe to be released from a lockdown.</li><li>New testing methods could speed up testing and drive costs down substantially.</li><li>We could also set up a tracing operation like the ones they have in China or other East Asia countries, where they can identify all the people that every sick person met, and can put them in quarantine. This would give us a ton of intelligence to release later on our social distancing measures: if we know where the virus is, we can target these places only. This is not rocket science: it\u2019s the basics of how East Asia Countries have been able to control this outbreak without the kind of draconian social distancing that is increasingly essential in other countries.</li></ul><p>The measures from this section (testing and tracing) single-handedly curbed the growth of the coronavirus in South Korea and got the epidemic under control, without a strong imposition of social distancing measures.</p><h2>Build Up Capacity</h2><p>The US (and presumably the UK) are about to go to war without armor.</p><p>We have masks for just two weeks, few personal protective equipments (\u201cPPE\u201d), not enough ventilators, not enough ICU beds, not enough ECMOs (blood oxygenation machines)\u2026 This is why the fatality rate would be so high in a mitigation strategy.</p><p>But if we buy ourselves some time, we can turn this around:</p><ul><li>We have more time to buy equipment we will need for a future wave</li><li>We can quickly build up our production of masks, PPEs, ventilators, ECMOs, and any other critical device to reduce fatality rate.</li></ul><p>Put in another way: we don\u2019t need years to get our armor, we need weeks. Let\u2019s do everything we can to get our production humming now. Countries are mobilized. People are being inventive, such as using 3D printing for ventilator parts. We can do it. We just need more time. Would you wait a few weeks to get yourself some armor before facing a mortal enemy?</p><p>This is not the only capacity we need. We will need health workers as soon as possible. Where will we get them? We need to train people to assist nurses, and we need to get medical workers out of retirement. Many countries have already started, but this takes time. We can do this in a few weeks, but not if everything collapses.</p><h2>Lower Public Contagiousness</h2><p>The public is scared. The coronavirus is new. There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know how to do yet! People haven\u2019t learned to stop hand-shaking. They still hug. They don\u2019t open doors with their elbow. They don\u2019t wash their hands after touching a door knob. They don\u2019t disinfect tables before sitting.</p><p>Once we have enough masks, we can use them outside of the healthcare system too. Right now, it\u2019s better to keep them for healthcare workers. But if they weren\u2019t scarce, people should wear them in their daily lives, making it less likely that they infect other people when sick, and with proper training also reducing the likelihood that the wearers get infected. (In the meantime, wearing something is better than nothing.)</p><p>All of these are pretty cheap ways to reduce the transmission rate. The less this virus propagates, the fewer measures we\u2019ll need in the future to contain it. But we need time to educate people on all these measures and equip them.</p><h2>Understand the Virus</h2><p>We know very very little about the virus. But every week, hundreds of new papers are coming.</p><p>The world is finally united against a common enemy. Researchers around the globe are mobilizing to understand this virus better.</p><p>How does the virus spread?How can contagion be slowed down?What is the share of asymptomatic carriers?Are they contagious? How much?What are good treatments?How long does it survive?On what surfaces?How do different social distancing measures impact the transmission rate?What\u2019s their cost?What are tracing best practices?How reliable are our tests?</p><p>Clear answers to these questions will help make our response as targeted as possible while minimizing collateral economic and social damage. And they will come in weeks, not years.</p><h2>Find Treatments</h2><p>Not only that, but what if we found a treatment in the next few weeks? Any day we buy gets us closer to that. Right now, there are already several candidates, such as Favipiravir, Chloroquine, or Chloroquine combined with Azithromycin. What if it turned out that in two months we discovered a treatment for the coronavirus? How stupid would we look if we already had millions of deaths following a mitigation strategy?</p><h2>Understand the Cost-Benefits</h2><p>All of the factors above can help us save millions of lives. That should be enough. Unfortunately, politicians can\u2019t only think about the lives of the infected. They must think about all the population, and heavy social distancing measures have an impact on others.</p><p>Right now we have no idea how different social distancing measures reduce transmission. We also have no clue what their economic and social costs are.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it a bit difficult to decide what measures we need for the long term if we don\u2019t know their cost or benefit?</p><p>A few weeks would give us enough time to start studying them, understand them, prioritize them, and decide which ones to follow.</p><p>Fewer cases, more understanding of the problem, building up assets, understanding the virus, understanding the cost-benefit of different measures, educating the public\u2026 These are some core tools to fight the virus, and we just need a few weeks to develop many of them. Wouldn\u2019t it be dumb to commit to a strategy that throws us instead, unprepared, into the jaws of our enemy?</p><h1>4. The Hammer and the Dance</h1><p>Now we know that the Mitigation Strategy is probably a terrible choice, and that the Suppression Strategy has a massive short-term advantage.</p><p>But people have rightful concerns about this strategy:</p><ul><li>How long will it actually last?</li><li>How expensive will it be?</li><li>Will there be a second peak as big as if we didn\u2019t do anything?</li></ul><p>Here, we\u2019re going to look at what a true Suppression Strategy would look like. We can call it the Hammer and the Dance.</p><h2>The Hammer</h2><p>First, you act quickly and aggressively. For all the reasons we mentioned above, given the value of time, we want to quench this thing as soon as possible.</p><p>One of the most important questions is: How long will this last?</p><p>The fear that everybody has is that we will be locked inside our homes for months at a time, with the ensuing economic disaster and mental breakdowns. This idea was unfortunately entertained in the famous Imperial College paper:</p><p>Do you remember this chart? The light blue area that goes from end of March to end of August is the period that the paper recommends as the Hammer, the initial suppression that includes heavy social distancing.</p><p>If you\u2019re a politician and you see that one option is to let hundreds of thousands or millions of people die with a mitigation strategy and the other is to stop the economy for five months before going through the same peak of cases and deaths, these don\u2019t sound like compelling options.</p><p>But this doesn\u2019t need to be so. This paper, driving policy today, has been brutally criticized for core flaws: They ignore contact tracing (at the core of policies in South Korea, China or Singapore among others) or travel restrictions (critical in China), ignore the impact of big crowds\u2026</p><p>The time needed for the Hammer is weeks, not months.</p><p>This graph shows the new cases in the entire Hubei region (60 million people) every day since 1/23. Within 2 weeks, the country was starting to get back to work. Within ~5 weeks it was completely under control. And within 7 weeks the new diagnostics was just a trickle. Let\u2019s remember this was the worst region in China.</p><p>Remember again that these are the orange bars. The grey bars, the true cases, had plummeted much earlier (see Chart 9).</p><p>The measures they took were pretty similar to the ones taken in Italy, Spain or France: isolations, quarantines, people had to stay at home unless there was an emergency or had to buy food, contact tracing, testing, more hospital beds, travel bans\u2026</p><p>Details matter, however.</p><p>China\u2019s measures were stronger. For example, people were limited to one person per household allowed to leave home every three days to buy food. Also, their enforcement was severe. It is likely that this severity stopped the epidemic faster.</p><p>In Italy, France and Spain, measures were not as drastic, and their implementation is not as tough. People still walk on the streets, many without masks. This is likely to result in a slower Hammer: more time to fully control the epidemic.</p><p>Some people interpret this as \u201cDemocracies will never be able to replicate this reduction in cases\u201d. That\u2019s wrong.</p><p>For several weeks, South Korea had the worst epidemic outside of China. Now, it\u2019s largely under control. And they did it without asking people to stay home. They achieved it mostly with very aggressive testing, contact tracing, and enforced quarantines and isolations.</p><p>The following table gives a good sense of what measures different countries have followed, and how that has impacted them (this is a work-in-progress. Feedback welcome.)</p><p>This shows how countries who were prepared, with stronger epidemiological authority, education on hygiene and social distancing, and early detection and isolation, didn\u2019t have to pay with heavier measures afterwards.</p><p>Conversely, countries like Italy, Spain or France weren\u2019t doing these well, and had to then apply the Hammer with the hard measures at the bottom to catch up.</p><p>The lack of measures in the US and UK is in stark contrast, especially in the US. These countries are still not doing what allowed Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan to control the virus, despite their outbreaks growing exponentially. But it\u2019s a matter of time. Either they have a massive epidemic, or they realize late their mistake, and have to overcompensate with a heavier Hammer. There is no escape from this.</p><p>But it\u2019s doable. If an outbreak like South Korea\u2019s can be controlled in weeks and without mandated social distancing, Western countries, which are already applying a heavy Hammer with strict social distancing measures, can definitely control the outbreak within weeks. It\u2019s a matter of discipline, execution, and how much the population abides by the rules.</p><p>Once the Hammer is in place and the outbreak is controlled, the second phase begins: the Dance.</p><h2>The Dance</h2><p>If you hammer the coronavirus, within a few weeks you\u2019ve controlled it and you\u2019re in much better shape to address it. Now comes the longer-term effort to keep this virus contained until there\u2019s a vaccine.</p><p>This is probably the single biggest, most important mistake people make when thinking about this stage: they think it will keep them home for months. This is not the case at all. In fact, it is likely that our lives will go back to close to normal.</p><h2>The Dance in Successful Countries</h2><p>How come South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan have had cases for a long time, in the case of South Korea thousands of them, and yet they\u2019re not locked down home?</p><a>Coronavirus: South Korea seeing a 'stabilising trend'South Korea's Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha, says she thinks early testing has been the key to South Korea's low\u2026www.bbc.com</a><p>In this video, the South Korea Foreign Minister explains how her country did it. It was pretty simple: efficient testing, efficient tracing, travel bans, efficient isolating and efficient quarantining.</p><p>This paper explains Singapore\u2019s approach:</p><a>Interrupting transmission of COVID-19: lessons from containment efforts in SingaporeHighlight. Despite multiple importations resulting in local chains of transmission, Singapore has been able to control\u2026academic.oup.com</a><p>Want to guess their measures? The same ones as in South Korea. In their case, they complemented with economic help to those in quarantine and travel bans and delays.</p><p>Is it too late for countries with outbreaks to follow this model? No. By applying the Hammer, they\u2019re getting a new chance, a new shot at doing this right. The more they wait, the heavier and longer the hammer, but it can control the epidemics.</p><p>But what if all these measures aren\u2019t enough?</p><h2>The Dance of R</h2><p>I call the months-long period between the Hammer and a vaccine or effective treatment the Dance because it won\u2019t be a period during which measures are always the same harsh ones. Some regions will see outbreaks again, others won\u2019t for long periods of time. Depending on how cases evolve, we will need to tighten up social distancing measures or we will be able to release them. That is the dance of R: a dance of measures between getting our lives back on track and spreading the disease, one of economy vs. healthcare.</p><p>How does this dance work?</p><p>It all turns around the R. If you remember, it\u2019s the transmission rate. Early on in a standard, unprepared country, it\u2019s somewhere between 2 and 3: During the few weeks that somebody is infected, they infect between 2 and 3 other people on average.</p><p>If R is above 1, infections grow exponentially into an epidemic. If it\u2019s below 1, they die down.</p><p>During the Hammer, the goal is to get R as close to zero, as fast as possible, to quench the epidemic. In Wuhan, it is calculated that R was initially 3.9, and after the lockdown and centralized quarantine, it went down to 0.32.</p><p>But once you move into the Dance, you don\u2019t need to do that anymore. You just need your R to stay below 1: a lot of the social distancing measures have true, hard costs on people. They might lose their job, their business, their healthy habits\u2026</p><p>You can remain below R=1 with a few simple measures.</p><a>Detailed data, sources and assumptions here</a><p>This is an approximation of how different types of patients respond to the virus, as well as their contagiousness. Nobody knows the true shape of this curve, but we\u2019ve gathered data from different papers to approximate how it looks like.</p><p>Every day after they contract the virus, people have some contagion potential. Together, all these days of contagion add up to 2.5 contagions on average.</p><p>It is believed that there are some contagions already happening during the \u201cno symptoms\u201d phase. After that, as symptoms grow, usually people go to the doctor, get diagnosed, and their contagiousness diminishes.</p><p>For example, early on you have the virus but no symptoms, so you behave as normal. When you speak with people, you spread the virus. When you touch your nose and then open door knob, the next people to open the door and touch their nose get infected.</p><p>The more the virus is growing inside you, the more infectious you are. Then, once you start having symptoms, you might slowly stop going to work, stay in bed, wear a mask, or start going to the doctor. The bigger the symptoms, the more you distance yourself socially, reducing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Once you\u2019re hospitalized, even if you are very contagious you don\u2019t tend to spread the virus as much since you\u2019re isolated.</p><p>This is where you can see the massive impact of policies like those of Singapore or South Korea:</p><ul><li>If people are massively tested, they can be identified even before they have symptoms. Quarantined, they can\u2019t spread anything.</li><li>If people are trained to identify their symptoms earlier, they reduce the number of days in blue, and hence their overall contagiousness</li><li>If people are isolated as soon as they have symptoms, the contagions from the orange phase disappear.</li><li>If people are educated about personal distance, mask-wearing, washing hands or disinfecting spaces, they spread less virus throughout the entire period.</li></ul><p>Only when all these fail do we need heavier social distancing measures.</p><h2>The ROI of Social Distancing</h2><p>If with all these measures we\u2019re still way above R=1, we need to reduce the average number of people that each person meets.</p><p>There are some very cheap ways to do that, like banning events with more than a certain number of people (eg, 50, 500), or asking people to work from home when they can.</p><p>Other are much, much more expensive economically, socially and ethically, such as closing schools and universities, asking everybody to stay home, or closing businesses.</p><p>This chart is made up because it doesn\u2019t exist today. Nobody has done enough research about this or put together all these measures in a way that can compare them.</p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate, because it\u2019s the single most important chart that politicians would need to make decisions. It illustrates what is really going through their minds.</p><p>During the Hammer period, politicians want to lower R as much as possible, through measures that remain tolerable for the population. In Hubei, they went all the way to 0.32. We might not need that: maybe just to 0.5 or 0.6.</p><p>But during the Dance of the R period, they want to hover as close to 1 as possible, while staying below it over the long term term. That prevents a new outbreak, while eliminating the most drastic measures.</p><p>What this means is that, whether leaders realize it or not, what they\u2019re doing is:</p><ul><li>List all the measures they can take to reduce R</li><li>Get a sense of the benefit of applying them: the reduction in R</li><li>Get a sense of their cost: the economic, social, and ethical cost.</li><li>Stack-rank the initiatives based on their cost-benefit</li><li>Pick the ones that give the biggest R reduction up till 1, for the lowest cost.</li></ul><a>list from the CDC</a><p>Initially, their confidence on these numbers will be low. But that\u2018s still how they are thinking\u2014and should be thinking about it.</p><p>What they need to do is formalize the process: Understand that this is a numbers game in which we need to learn as fast as possible where we are on R, the impact of every measure on reducing R, and their social and economic costs.</p><p>Only then will they be able to make a rational decision on what measures they should take.</p><h1>Conclusion: Buy Us Time</h1><p>The coronavirus is still spreading nearly everywhere. 152 countries have cases. We are against the clock. But we don\u2019t need to be: there\u2019s a clear way we can be thinking about this.</p><p>Some countries, especially those that haven\u2019t been hit heavily yet by the coronavirus, might be wondering: Is this going to happen to me? The answer is: It probably already has. You just haven\u2019t noticed. When it really hits, your healthcare system will be in even worse shape than in wealthy countries where the healthcare systems are strong. Better safe than sorry, you should consider taking action now.</p><p>For the countries where the coronavirus is already here, the options are clear.</p><p>On one side, countries can go the mitigation route: create a massive epidemic, overwhelm the healthcare system, drive the death of millions of people, and release new mutations of this virus in the wild.</p><p>On the other, countries can fight. They can lock down for a few weeks to buy us time, create an educated action plan, and control this virus until we have a vaccine.</p><p>Governments around the world today, including some such as the US, the UK or Switzerland have so far chosen the mitigation path.</p><p>That means they\u2019re giving up without a fight. They see other countries having successfully fought this, but they say: \u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>What if Churchill had said the same thing? \u201cNazis are already everywhere in Europe. We can\u2019t fight them. Let\u2019s just give up.\u201d This is what many governments around the world are doing today. They\u2019re not giving you a chance to fight this. You have to demand it.</p><h1>Share the Word</h1><p>Unfortunately, millions of lives are still at stake.
